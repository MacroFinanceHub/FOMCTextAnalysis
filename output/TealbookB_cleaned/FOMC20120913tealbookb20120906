Alternative A and each of the B alternatives observe that employment has “increased somewhat” and note that the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Alternative C does not describe unemployment as elevated, and it characterizes employment growth as having “picked up.

In  contrast, Alternative C characterizes private domestic demand as having “continued to advance.   Likewise, Alternative A and each of the B alternatives note some further signs of improvement in the housing sector, albeit from a depressed level; Alternative C notes only the improvement.  With respect to inflation, Alternative A and each of the B alternatives indicate that it has been subdued but qualify that characterization by noting recent increases in “the prices of some key commodities.   Alternative C says that inflation has declined since earlier this year while also noting the significant increase in some commodity prices.

Alternative A and each of the B alternatives also differ from Alternative C in their approach to communicating the medium-term outlook for real activity and employment.

The language describing the outlook in Alternative A and the B alternatives has been changed significantly from the August statement.

In contrast, the characterization of the outlook  in Alternative C is unconditional and differs only slightly from that in the August statement.

With respect to the outlook for  inflation, Alternative A and each of the B alternatives indicate that the Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term “likely would run at or below” 2 percent, while Alternative C includes a projection that inflation over the medium term will run “near” the Committee’s 2 percent objective.

Alternative A describes an LSAP that is discrete in nature, announcing new purchases that will cumulate to $750 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and $500 by early 2014.   Alternatives B and embody incremental, flow-based approaches.  In particular, Alternative B indicates that the Committee will start purchasing $45 billion of longer-term Treasury securities per month and $30 billion of agency MBS per month and will continue adding to its holdings “until it has observed substantial ongoing improvement in labor market conditions,” provided that projected inflation over the medium term is “close to 2 percent” and longer-term inflation expectations remain stable.

Alternative B continues the MEP through year-end and adds $30 billion per month in purchases of  agency MBS; this alternative indicates that the Committee will undertake additional asset  purchases if “it does not observe substantial ongoing improvement in labor market   nor Alternative C initiates additional asset purchases at the September meeting.

In contrast, Alternative C would only continue the MEP through year-end, as announced in June.

Specifically, statements associated with Alternatives A and B say, “the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the conclusion of this asset-purchase program.

Alternative C offers the choice of making the anticipated date of the first increase in the funds rate a year earlier, or by replacing the current forward guidance—including the date—with new language that describes the factors the Committee will consider in deciding when first to raise its target for the funds rate.

Finally, Alternative A notes the possibility of a reduction in the remuneration rate on excess reserves from 25 basis points to 15 basis points in order to provide a modest amount of additional policy stimulus.

According to the Desk’s latest survey, a statement along the lines of the one  associated with Alternative B would likely be somewhat more accommodative than market participants expect.

These participants may want to adopt a statement such as the one presented in  Alternative A that expands the balance sheet through a large, discrete purchase program as in previous LSAP operations, and also extends the date in the forward rate guidance to “at least through mid-2015.

Moreover, members might also point out that the  type of LSAP envisioned in Alternative A is not truly “fixed;” the Committee has, in fact, made adjustments during earlier LSAP programs, as well as to its reinvestment policies, when conditions warranted.

Thus, a statement along the lines of  Alternative A would come as a surprise to investors and longer-term interest rates would 6 Additional considerations related to possible changes in the remuneration rate on excess reserves can be found in the memo by M.

Furthermore, participants have priced in significant odds of  additional asset purchases in the near future, and the statement in Alternative C without a change in the forward guidance) would be read as a signal that such action was very unlikely to be forthcoming, putting further upward pressure on longer-term rates and weighing on equity prices.  Any statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely lead to an appreciation of the dollar.

LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE  The staff has prepared four scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that  correspond to the policy alternatives A, B, B′, and C.1  Alternatives A, B, and B′ include  new asset purchase programs and extend the period over which the Committee anticipates  maintaining an exceptionally low funds rate to June 2015, while Alternative C continues the MEP through year-end with no additional purchase program and has the federal funds rate lift off from its lower bound in August 2014.

The scenario is also similar to the  example presented in the memo to the FOMC "Flow-Based Balance-Sheet Policies: Communication Issues  program detailed in the Alternative B statement if purchases last, and are expected to last, for a little more than a year.

Under Alternative A, reserve balances peak at about  trillion, while under Alternatives B and B respectively.

The directives for Alternatives A and B would instruct the Desk to begin new asset purchase programs.

Alternatives A and B would reinstitute the policy of rolling over maturing Treasuries at auction, while Alternatives B′, B′′, and C would continue the practice of redeeming maturing Treasury securities at auction.

The projection for the  scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target federal funds rate lifts off in August 2014, consistent with the draft statement language “at least through late [ 2013 | 2014 ]” and ten months earlier than in Alternative B.

ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B  are: o The Committee is assumed to halt the MEP at the end of September and begin a $1 trillion purchase program in October 2012 under which it purchases $600 billion in Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and $400 billion in current coupon agency MBS at a pace of about $30 billion per month into the fourth quarter of 2013.

The term premium is more  negative than it was in July Alternative B because of the a later liftoff date, which imply securities remain out of the hands of the public for longer than in the last Tealbook.

The effect is   Alternative B because of the smaller assumed purchase program.

The effect is   Alternative B because of the larger assumed purchase program.

The effect is  less negative than in Alternative B because there is no purchase program and the liftoff date is earlier.
