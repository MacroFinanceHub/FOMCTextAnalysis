Alternative B reaffirms the intended increase in securities holdings and the pace of purchases that the Committee announced in November.

Alternatives B and C retain the familiar “extended period” language.  Alternative D would signal that the period of exceptionally low funds rates is likely to come to an end in the near future and that the reinvestment of principal payments may also be brought to a close before long.

The statement under Alternative B would again characterize the information received over the intermeeting period as confirming that the economic recovery “continues to be slow,” and express the Committee’s judgment that “the unemployment rate is elevated.    Alternative B would state that measures of underlying inflation are “somewhat low” and that they “have continued to trend downward.

Alternative A does, however, retain the November characterization of household spending as increasing “gradually” (rather than “at a moderate pace,” as in Alternative B) and describes measures of underlying inflation as “low.

Alternative C would scale back the planned expansion of securities holdings to $400 billion and reduce the 50 billion per month.

Alternative D would state that the economic recovery “is proceeding.

A statement along the lines of Alternative B would probably not surprise market participants, but would likely serve to reduce uncertainty somewhat.

A statement along the lines of Alternative C would consequently come as a significant surprise to investors.

These effects would be reinforced to the extent that the adoption of  Alternative C was seen as opening the door to further reductions in the Committee’s purchase total going forward.

Reflecting such concerns, the language in Alternative D would position the Committee to begin removing policy accommodation before long.

The announcement of Alternative D would completely surprise market participants.

Relative to the November Tealbook, total assets in Alternative B are projected to be slightly higher than in the last Tealbook from the fourth quarter of 2012 through early 2016 primarily reflecting the later liftoff date for the federal funds rate.

The  directive for Alternative B would instruct the Desk to continue carrying out the increase in the SOMA’s securities holdings of $600 billion by the end of June 2011 through purchases of longer-term Treasury securities while also continuing the current policy of reinvesting principal payments on SOMA securities.

The directive for Alternative A  would increase the SOMA’s securities holdings by $800 billion by the end of September  2011 through the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities, while the corresponding  increase under the Alternative C directive is a total of 2011.  The directives for both Alternatives A and C continue the current portfolio policy of reinvesting principal payments.  The directive for Alternative D would instruct the Desk to maintain the SOMA’s total holdings of securities at approximately the current level by continuing to reinvest payments of principal from agency debt and MBS in longer-term Treasury securities.

ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency MBS, and Agency Debt Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B are o Purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities between November 75 billion per month.
