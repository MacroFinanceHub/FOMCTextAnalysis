In its description of recent economic developments, Alternative B begins by observing that, “apart from weather-related disruptions,” economic activity has continued to expand moderately and that employment growth has picked up a bit although the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Like the October statement, Alternative B notes that household spending has advanced; in light of recent data, however, October’s observation that this spending category has been rising a bit more quickly is omitted.

Alternative C offers a somewhat more upbeat characterization of the data by describing employment growth as having “strengthened somewhat” and stating that the “unemployment rate, though still elevated, has declined.

Alternative C also drops the reference in the October statement to slower growth in business fixed investment, instead observing more broadly that private domestic demand has continued to advance.

With respect to inflation, Alternatives A and B say that it “has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices,” while Alternative C states that inflation “has been running close” to the Committee’s longer-run objective and does not cite energy prices.

The language in Alternative B follows the October statement language on the outlook for real activity and employment, reiterating the Committee’s concern that, without sufficient policy accommodation, “economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.

With  respect to inflation, Alternatives A and B state that the Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term “likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective,” while Alternative C indicates that inflation over the medium term “will run near its 2 percent objective.

Alternative B maintains the purchases of agency MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and indicates that, after the completion of the MEP at the end of the year, the Committee will purchase longer-term 45 billion per month.

Alternative A would increase the monthly flow of purchases of agency MBS to $50 billion per month beginning in January and would increase the flow of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to $50 billion per month after the MEP concludes.   Moreover, the draft statement for Alternative A indicates that the purchases will continue until the Committee judges that data on economic activity and labor market conditions are consistent with an outlook for sustained progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability.  In contrast, Alternative C announces that purchases of both MBS and longer-term Treasury securities will stop at year-end.

Both  Alternatives A and B would continue to indicate that the Committee will also take into 1 The sales side of the MEP will, by the end of the year, have brought down to near zero the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities of maturities within three years.

Alternative A and one of the two versions of the forward guidance for Alternative B would provide quantitative thresholds that link the Committee’s eventual reconsideration of the target range for the federal funds rate to labor market conditions and the outlook for inflation.

Alternative A and one  of the two versions of the forward guidance for Alternative B would provide quantitative  thresholds that link the Committee’s eventual reconsideration of the target range for the  federal funds rate to labor market conditions and the outlook for inflation.3  The draft  language for Alternative B states that the Committee “currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than ½ percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.   Alternative A adopts this formulation too, except that the unemployment threshold is 6 percent.

Another new sentence in Alternative B indicates that the Committee views these thresholds as “consistent with its earlier date-based forward guidance.

This sentence  does not appear in Alternative A because the 6 percent unemployment threshold in Alternative A would likely amount to a shift in forward guidance toward a longer period of exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate than was indicated in October.

Further sentences in the new forward guidance in both Alternatives A and B state that other indicators of economic and financial conditions will also enter into the decision to tighten, and that when the Committee begins to remove policy accommodation, it “will take a balanced approach” in line with its statutory mandate.

The other version of the forward guidance in Alternative B is closer to the language used in October.

15 of 63       of Alternative B include optional additional language intended to clarify that the firming of the funds rate will occur after the Committee “sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market” and “the asset purchase program ends.

One variant of the  fifth paragraph of Alternative C retains language from the October statement without this new clarifying phrase, while providing the option of stating that highly accommodative policy will remain appropriate for “some time” after the economic recovery strengthens instead of “for a considerable time.   This variant of the paragraph in Alternative C gives the choice of several dates, each prior to mid-2015, through which exceptionally low federal funds rates would be warranted.

The other variant of the fifth paragraph of  Alternative C describes qualitative factors the Committee will consider in deciding when to raise its target for the funds rate.

Nonetheless, policymakers may anticipate that the January meeting will  provide a better vantage point for assessing the fiscal situation, and for determining  whether monetary policy accommodation, beyond that implied by the current pace of                                                    4 The Desk’s proposed distribution for the Treasury securities purchases under Alternatives A and B implies a 9-year duration of purchases, about the same as the duration of net purchases under the MEP but greater than under LSAP1 or LSAP2.

Moreover, some members may view the language in Alternative B that the new year’s Treasury purchases will proceed “initially at a pace of $45 billion per month” as useful in conveying the message that purchases could be scaled back if evidence emerged of rising costs of purchases.

The draft statement in Alternative B also indicates that the Committee will continue to take a balanced approach toward meeting its objectives after a threshold is crossed.

These policymakers may prefer a statement along the lines of the variant in   Alternative B that preserves the date-based forward guidance language.

All told, a December statement along the lines of Alternative B would not surprise market participants in terms of the announced flows of asset purchases, but the shift to thresholds-based forward guidance would be somewhat unexpected.

Moreover, while dealers do expect threshold  language to be adopted by the FOMC eventually, the 6 percent unemployment threshold  in Alternative A is lower, and so implies a more expansionary policy, than dealers expect to be associated with thresholds-based guidance.

However, if investors read the statement of Alternative A as indicating that the FOMC has a relatively gloomy outlook for growth and employment, equity prices would rise by less or could even decline.

If so, they   Alternative C that includes paragraph C.

A statement along the lines of Alternative C would greatly surprise market participants and would be interpreted as signaling a significantly more rapid removal of policy accommodation than investors had expected.

Alternatives A and B include asset purchases that continue beyond the end of the year and assume that the Committee maintains an exceptionally low federal funds rate until October 2015.

In  contrast, Alternative C ends purchases at the end of this year and has the federal funds rate lift off from its lower bound in October 2014.

In the Alternative B scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is in October 2015 as in the staff forecast.

This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is two months later than  that assumed in the balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the October Tealbook and is consistent with the policy assumption in the current staff forecast in Tealbook Book A.

15 Alternative B is similar to the memo for the December FOMC.

Based on those interest rate assumptions, the  750 billion purchase program in the options memo and for Alternative B in the October Tealbook suggested that the Federal Reserve experiences a temporary period of operating losses.

Remittances are higher, and a  deferred asset is not booked, in the current projection for Alternative B because the interest rate assumptions are lower than in the previous Tealbook in 2015 through 2020, reflecting a downward revision to the projection for economic activity and an associated widening of the output gap.

18 Alternative A is similar to the for the December FOMC.

In this scenario, the federal funds rate is assumed to lift off in   Alternatives B and A.

For the scenarios  corresponding to Alternatives B and A, reserve balances are respectively, when the federal funds rate lifts off from its lower bound in October 2015.

Under  Alternatives B and C, such sales are sufficient to normalize the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over three years or less, consistent with the exit strategy principles.

The draft directive for Alternative A directs the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency MBS at a pace of about $40 billion per month until the end of December 2012 and to raise the flow of purchases to $50 billion beginning in January 2013; it does not specify an end-date for these purchases.

The draft directive for  Alternative B instructs the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency MBS at a pace 40 billion per month; it, too, does not specify an end-date.

The directive for  Alternative C instructs the Desk to continue its purchases of agency MBS at a pace of 40 billion per month until the end of December 2012.

The Tealbook projections for the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives B and A assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in October 2015.

This date of liftoff is  consistent with the current staff economic forecast but is two months later than assumed in the   Alternative B in the October Tealbook.

The projection for the  scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target federal funds rate lifts off in October 2014, consistent with the draft statement language “at least through [late 2014 | mid-2014 | late ” and a year earlier than in Alternative B.

55 of 63 ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B  are: o The Committee is assumed to continue its current purchases of MBS through the end of the year, when the MEP concludes, and then continue MBS purchases and additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities through June 2013.

As a result, in Alternatives B and A, premiums are boosted by 41 billion, respectively, by the time asset purchases end.

This estimate is the same as in Alternative A and reflects the fact that market participants are expecting an asset purchase program more in line with Alternative A.

The effect is  less negative than in Alternative B because there are no additional securities purchases in 2013 and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternatives B and A.
