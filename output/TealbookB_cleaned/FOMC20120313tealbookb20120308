Alternative B notes that labor market conditions “have improved further,” while Alternative A says these conditions have improved “somewhat” further.

While each  statement reiterates that the unemployment rate “remains elevated,” Alternative B states that it has “declined notably” in recent months, and Alternative C observes that this rate has declined notably and the pace of employment growth has “picked up.

The  statements also vary in describing the recent increase in the prices of crude oil and  gasoline, with Alternatives A and B noting that these prices “have increased lately,” and Alternative C saying they have “increased significantly of late.

The statements differ in  their characterization of recent conditions in the housing sector as well, with Alternatives  A and B saying that this sector “remains depressed,” while Alternative C notes that housing indicators “have improved somewhat.

Alternative B indicates that the Committee expects “moderate” economic growth with the unemployment rate declining “gradually.   Alternative A says that, absent further policy action, economic growth “would slow” and the unemployment rate would decline “only gradually.   Meanwhile, Alternative C notes that “a gradual increase” in the pace of economic growth is expected along with a rate of unemployment that will “continue to decline.   Alternatives A and B observe that the recent increase in the prices of crude oil and gasoline will push up inflation temporarily, and Alternative A adds that the increase is likely to reduce consumers’ purchasing power.

In contrast,  Alternative C says this development is likely to push inflation above its mandate- consistent rate in the near term.

In contrast,  Alternative C says this development is likely to push inflation above its mandate-        consistent rate in the near term.1  In describing the risks to the outlook, Alternatives A  and B cite strains in global financial markets as continuing to pose significant downside   Alternative B notes that these risks have “eased somewhat.

Against this backdrop, Alternative B makes no change either to the Committee’s current guidance regarding the anticipated period of exceptionally low federal funds rates or to its balance sheet policies.  Alternative A preserves the Committee’s current forward rate guidance and provides additional policy accommodation by undertaking one of two new asset purchase programs—either a discrete program to buy an additional $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by the end of March 2013, or an incremental and open-ended program to buy $40 billion of agency MBS per month, with adjustments as needed.

Specifically, Alternative C would reduce the size of the maturity extension program by about one-third and end it in March, three months earlier than originally announced; Alternative C would also eliminate the date in the Committee’s forward guidance and instead describe the time period over which the exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate is appropriate as being linked qualitatively to economic conditions involving projected inflation, longer-term inflation expectations, and the state of progress toward maximum employment.

Alternatives B and C say the Committee is “prepared to adjust” its holdings of securities as appropriate, while under Alternative A, the Committee will more broadly “employ its tools as needed.   Alternatives A and B indicate that future actions would be undertaken to strengthen the economic recovery; under Alternative C, the Committee’s is more balanced.

A statement along the lines of Alternative B would be in line with the expectations of financial market participants.

Alternative A presents two variants of a program to purchase additional agency MBS.

In contrast, members may opt for         an open-ended purchase program if they believe that more flexibility is needed to tailor  the ultimate size of the purchase program to evolving economic conditions.2    A statement along the lines of Alternative A would surprise financial market participants.

A statement along the lines of Alternative C would come as a great surprise to financial market participants.

With market participants currently expecting the first increase in the federal funds rate  target to occur sometime in the third quarter of 2014, the actions announced in paragraph  3 of Alternative C would likely cause participants to price in a much faster exit from the current accommodative policy stance, leaving market interest rates higher, especially in the two- to three-year sector of yield curve.

The size of the balance sheet   Alternative B as it did in the January Tealbook.

As in Alternative B, reinvestment ends in April 2014, the target  federal funds rate lifts off in October 2014, sales of agency securities commence in April  2015, and holdings of agency securities fall to zero over five years.5  The additional                                                    1 This date of the federal funds liftoff is the same as in the January Alternative B balance sheet projection, but later than the April 2014 date assumed in the current Tealbook financial projection.

Under the current projections, even under Alternative A, which has the highest level of sales, losses  purchases of agency MBS under Alternative A postpone the normalization of the size of the balance sheet until March 2018, five months later than under Alternative B.

On the liability side of the balance sheet, the forecasted path for reserve balances   Alternative B is roughly unchanged from the previous Tealbook’s baseline.

The monetary base under  Alternative A expands in the near term along with the rise in reserve balances that comes from the additional asset purchases.

6 To simplify the projections, the prepayment paths for agency MBS holdings and the premiums   Alternative C match those for Alternative B.

Annual - Q4 to Q4  Monthly Growth Rates for the Monetary Base  Date Alternative B Alternative A Percent, annual rate Alternative C Memo : January Tealbook Quarterly DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY FORECASTS The staff projects that domestic nonfinancial sector debt will increase at an annual rate of 4¾ percent over the first half of this year, reflecting continued rapid expansion in federal government debt and a modest rise in private nonfinancial debt.

Regarding the instructions for managing the size of the SOMA, the directives for  Alternatives B and C would instruct the Desk to leave the total face value of domestic securities in the SOMA about unchanged.

About the instructions for managing the composition of the SOMA, the directives  for Alternatives A and B would instruct the Desk to take appropriate steps to complete by the end of June 2012 the $400 billion maturity extension program that was announced last September.  The directive for Alternative C would instead instruct the Desk to reduce the amounts of purchases and sales associated with the maturity extension program to 250 billion each and to complete these operations by the end of March.

The Tealbook projections for the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives A and B assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in October 2014, consistent with the statements’ language that the federal funds rate will be at exceptionally low levels “at least through late 2014.

This date of liftoff is the same as that used in the January Tealbook for the  Alternative A and B balance sheet projections, but later than that assumed in the March Tealbook financial projection.   The projection for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target rate lifts off in January 2013.

The balance sheet projections assume that no use of short- term draining tools is necessary to achieve the projected path for the federal funds rate.3  ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B are: o Over the nine months beginning in October 2011, the FOMC is assumed to purchase $400 billion in par value of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of six years or more and sell the same par amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three years or less.

Reserve balances will increase by the same amount  The large-scale asset purchase program in Alternative A would put downward pressure on market interest rates, in particular mortgage rates, and result in more MBS prepayments than in the baseline.
