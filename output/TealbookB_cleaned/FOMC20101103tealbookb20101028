Under Alternatives A and B, the Committee would provide more monetary policy stimulus by increasing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of longer- term securities.

Alternative A includes explicit forward guidance about the period over which the funds rate is likely to stay at its effective lower bound.  Alternatives B and C maintain the “extended period” language as part of the forward guidance about the target rate.

Alternative D would signal that the period of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation is likely to come to an end in the near future.

The statement under Alternative B would characterize the information received over the intermeeting period as confirming that the economic recovery “continues to be slow.

Alternative D would state that the “economic recovery is proceeding” and note that “the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.

The statement in Alternative B would underscore the commitment of the Committee to its dual mandate, thereby helping to anchor inflation expectations.

A statement along the lines of Alternative B would probably not greatly surprise market participants.

In light of current market expectations for additional policy easing at this meeting,  a statement along the lines of that in Alternative C would come as a significant surprise to market participants and, as a result, longer-term interest rates would back up, stock prices fall, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would increase.

The language in Alternative D would position the Committee to begin removing policy accommodation before long.

The Committee may view the economic  costs associated with such outcomes as likely to be higher than those that would result  from an earlier but more gradual removal of policy accommodation, suggesting that the   Alternative D may best manage these longer-term risks.

The announcement of Alternative D would completely surprise market participants.

Under Alternatives C and D, only the proceeds from principal payments of agency securities are reinvested in Treasury securities; in these alternatives, the balance sheet immediately begins a modest pace of contraction and then declines more rapidly when asset sales begin.

The  directive for Alternatives A and B would instruct the Desk to increase the SOMA’s securities holdings by $1 trillion by the end of December 2011 through the purchase of longer-term Treasury securities while continuing the current portfolio policy of reinvesting principal payments.  Alternative B would instruct the Desk to increase the SOMA’s securities holdings by $600 trillion by the end of June 2011 through the purchases of longer-term Treasury securities while continuing the current portfolio policy of reinvesting principal payments.  The directives that correspond to Alternatives C and D would instruct the Desk to maintain the SOMA’s total holdings of securities at approximately the current level by continuing to reinvest repayments of principal from agency debt and MBS in longer-term Treasury securities.
