All characterize  fiscal policy as restraining economic growth; Alternative A also notes slower manufacturing activity.  Alternative B indicates that there has been “further improvement” in labor market conditions in recent months, while Alternative C indicates that labor market conditions have “continued to improve,” citing “ongoing gains in payroll employment.   Alternative A offers a less positive characterization of the labor market, indicating that labor market conditions have shown “some improvement,” on balance.

In line with the previous FOMC statement, Alternatives B and C indicate that inflation “has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective” and that longer-term inflation expectations “have remained stable.   Alternative A also mentions the stability of inflation expectations, but states that inflation has been running “below” its longer-run objective, “even apart from” temporary variations in energy prices.

In characterizing the economic outlook, both Alternatives B and C continue to state that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the Committee expects economic growth to proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate to decline gradually toward mandate-consistent levels.  Alternatives B and C also continue to say that the Committee “anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.   Alternative B indicates that the downside risks to the outlook for the economy, and also the labor market, have diminished since the fall.

Alternative A takes a different approach, indicating that the outlook, conditioned on “a balanced approach to fostering maximum employment and price stability,” is for moderate growth, a gradually declining unemployment rate, and inflation moving up to its 2 percent objective, “or even modestly higher for a time.   Alternative A also retains the language that the Committee “continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook.

Regarding balance sheet policy, Alternatives A and B continue purchases of agency MBS and longer-term Treasury securities at the same monthly rates as those the Committee specified in May.  In contrast, Alternative C reduces the monthly flow of purchases of both agency MBS and longer-term Treasury securities to [$35] billion each per month.

In addition, the new language in  Alternative B that points to “diminished” downside risks to the outlook for “the economy and the labor market” is intended to signal that the Committee is prepared to reduce the pace of purchases if the data in coming months show continuing improvement in labor market conditions.

In addition, Alternative A adds language declaring that the Committee now intends “to rely upon the paydowns of principal rather than sales of agency mortgage-backed securities when it eventually becomes appropriate to reduce its holdings of those securities.

Alternatives B and C would also retain the unemployment rate threshold at 6½ percent, while Alternative A would lower this threshold to either 6 or 5½ percent.  Alternative C states that the Committee “reaffirms” (rather than “currently anticipates”) that the federal funds rate will remain exceptionally low at least until one of the thresholds is crossed; the use of “reaffirms” is meant to emphasize that reducing the pace of asset purchases does not signal a change in the Committee’s reaction function for the federal funds rate.  Alternative A differs from Alternatives B and C in providing additional guidance about how the Committee plans to remove policy accommodation.  In particular, Alternative A notes that the Committee “expects… that it will be appropriate” to adjust policy “gradually in order to foster strong modestly higher for a time.

Altogether, this  evidence suggests that a policy decision along the lines of Alternative B would largely be in line with many market participants’ expectations; nevertheless, the new language that the Committee sees diminished downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market could be somewhat surprising, and interest rates might move higher, equity prices could fall, and the dollar could appreciate.

For all of these reasons, participants might prefer a statement  like Alternative C that reduces the pace of purchases of Treasury securities and agency Some policymakers may be skeptical that the current program of purchasing longer-term securities is reducing interest rates appreciably, or that it is having a significant effect on macroeconomic outcomes.

A decision to adopt a statement like Alternative C at this meeting would come as a surprise to market participants and might be seen as an indication that the Committee will end asset purchases sooner and acquire an appreciably smaller total stock of securities than market participants currently anticipate.

Alternative A provides more accommodation than Alternative B by lowering the forward guidance threshold for the unemployment rate and by providing additional guidance about the eventual removal of policy accommodation.

Alternative A provides more accommodation than Alternative B by lowering the  forward guidance threshold for the unemployment rate and by providing additional  guidance about the eventual removal of policy accommodation.1  In particular,  Alternative A says “the Committee expects that when the time comes to reduce policy accommodation, it will be appropriate to do so gradually in order to foster stronger modestly higher for a time.

Alternative A would also imply holding a larger stock of assets for a longer time than under Alternative B, by stating that the Committee intends to rely on paydowns of principal rather than sales of agency MBS when it becomes appropriate to reduce its MBS holdings.

Alternative A would surprise market participants.

If, however, investors took a statement like Alternative A to indicate that the FOMC has become more pessimistic about the outlook for economic growth and employment than market participants had anticipated, equity prices might not rise or could even decline.

The directives for Alternatives A and B are unchanged; the draft for C suggests a modest update to make the language of the directive consistent with the corresponding post-meeting statement.

The draft directives for Alternatives A and B instruct the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month and to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about 45 billion per month.  The draft directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about [$35] billion per month, and to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about [$35] billion per month, beginning in July.

All three alternatives include  additional asset purchases, though the pace and cumulative amount of purchases differ.2   Alternative B continues purchases at the current pace through September, at which point the monthly purchases are reduced; purchases conclude by year-end.

Alternative C decreases the pace of purchases immediately and ends purchases in August.

Projections under each scenario are based on assumptions about the trajectory of  various components of the balance sheet and the balance sheet normalization strategy.3   The projections for Alternatives B and C assume that the Committee follows an exit strategy consistent with the principles articulated in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting, which includes sales of agency MBS over a five-year period.

The projections in  Alternative A, on the other hand, assume no sales of agency MBS and that the SOMA  portfolio declines only through the passive redemption of SOMA assets.4  The  accompanying box, “Alternative B without Agency MBS Sales,” discusses the implications of assuming no sales of agency MBS for the scenario corresponding to Alternative B.

4 This assumption is consistent with the new language for Alternative A that notes that the Committee now intends “to rely upon the paydowns of principal rather than sales of agency mortgage- backed securities when it eventually becomes appropriate to reduce its holdings of those securities.

Alternative B without Agency MBS Sales The balance sheet projection for Alternative B assumes agency MBS are sold over five years, consistent with the June 2011 exit strategy principles.

In this box, we  present a projection for the balance sheet under Alternative B that compares the staff’s standard exit strategy assumptions with the assumption that agency MBS holdings decline only through passive redemptions.

On net, Federal Reserve net  income is higher than under Alternative B because the elimination of realized losses more than offsets the increase in interest expense.

Through these redemptions and sales, the size of the  portfolio is normalized by May 2019.9,10  The balance sheet then begins to expand, with                                                    6 As discussed in the Monetary Policy Alternatives section of Tealbook Book B, the wording of  Alternative B is intended to suggest that the Committee could reduce the pace of purchases if the data in coming months show continuing improvement in labor market conditions.

8 This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is two quarters earlier than that assumed in the balance   Alternative B in the April Tealbook.

The first increase in the  target federal funds rate occurs in late 2015, later than in Alternative B because of the 5½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate.

The Tealbook projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative B assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in May 2015.

This date of liftoff is consistent with the  current staff economic forecast and the thresholds described in the May 2013 FOMC statement,  and it is two quarters earlier than assumed in the balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the April Tealbook.

The projections for the scenario   Alternative C assume the target federal funds rate lifts off in late 2014.

ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B are: o The Committee is assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and of longer-term Treasury securities by $45 billion per month through September 2013.

The effect is  less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer securities purchased in 2013 and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternative B.
