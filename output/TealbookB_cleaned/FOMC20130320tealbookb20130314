Alternative B indicates that incoming data suggest “a return to moderate economic growth” while Alternative A simply indicates that economic growth “has resumed.   Alternative C offers a somewhat more positive characterization of the recent performance of the economy by stating that “the pace of economic growth has picked up.   Alternatives B and C observe that the housing sector “has strengthened further;” Alternative A cites “further improvement,” as in the January statement.

Alternatives A and B acknowledge that “fiscal policy has become somewhat more restrictive,” while Alternative C does not mention fiscal restraint.

Regarding the recent  news on the labor market, Alternative B states that “labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months.

In characterizing the economic outlook, Alternative B continues to state that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the Committee expects economic growth to proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate to decline gradually toward mandate- consistent levels.

In light of its more positive reading of the recent economic data,  Alternative C indicates that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will “pick up further over time.   In contrast, Alternative A says that, “without further” policy accommodation, economic growth “might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.

With respect to inflation,  Alternative B maintains the formulation used in January, stating that the Committee “anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.   Alternative A indicates that medium-term inflation likely will be “somewhat below” its 2 percent objective while Alternative C says that inflation is likely to run “close to” its 2 percent objective over the medium term.

The draft statements for Alternatives A and B continue to note downside risks to the economic outlook.  While Alternative B does not mention specific risks, Alternative A points to strains in global financial markets and to “unresolved fiscal issues” as posing downside risks to the economic outlook.

Alternative B continues purchases of agency MBS and longer-term Treasury securities at the same monthly rates as those the Committee specified in January.

In  contrast, Alternative C would reduce the monthly flows of purchases of both agency 30 billion per month.  Alternative A would 100 billion per month.

In  explaining the Committee’s balance sheet policy, Alternatives B and C clarify that its decisions about the pace of asset purchases are based on both its “outlook for the labor market and inflation” and its “current assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases.   In contrast, Alternative A states that the more rapid pace of asset purchases should “put additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates” and is intended to support a stronger economic recovery.

The proposed statement for Alternative B frames the Committee’s future decisions about the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases in terms of the Committee’s evaluation of their likely efficacy and costs, as in recent statements, but adds “as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.   Alternative C states, instead, that the Committee “is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of purchases if the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes, with the purpose of maintaining appropriate policy accommodation.   Alternative A uses much the same language as the January statement.

As in January, Alternatives B and C would keep the unemployment rate threshold at 6½ percent, while Alternative A would lower this threshold to 5½ percent.

However, the size and nature of the market reaction to the new language in  Alternative B is difficult to predict.

They may therefore conclude that it is appropriate to step up the rate of purchases Some policymakers may be concerned that additional asset purchases could lead to a  reduction in remittances to zero and result in a deferred asset.3  Nonetheless, they may  see that risk as offset by the very high likelihood that the overall fiscal effect of additional  asset purchases will be positive, because such purchases will help spur stronger  macroeconomic outcomes.4    An announcement like Alternative A that raised purchases of agency mortgage- backed securities and longer-term Treasury securities to a combined pace of $100 billion per month would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.

Moreover, according to  the latest survey, dealers do not expect the threshold language to be changed, so the 5½  percent unemployment threshold in Alternative A implies a longer period of very low short-term interest rates than dealers currently expect.

However, if investors read the statement of Alternative A as indicating that the FOMC has a relatively gloomy outlook for economic growth and employment, equity prices might not rise or could even decline.

A statement like Alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market participants and might well be interpreted as signaling not only smaller total asset purchases but also a significantly earlier removal of policy accommodation than investors had expected.

Accordingly, a  statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely lead investors to mark down significantly their expectations of the Committee’s cumulative asset purchases, and so would cause a sizable upward shift in market participant’s expectations of the likely path for longer-term yields.

The draft directive for Alternative B instructs the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency MBS at a pace of about $40 billion per month and to continue 45 billion per month.

The  draft directive for Alternative A directs the Desk to purchase additional agency MBS at a pace of about $45 billion per month and to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a 55 billion per month.  The draft directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to purchase agency MBS at a pace of about $30 billion per month and to purchase 30 billion per month.

Alternative B continues purchases of 40 billion per month of agency MBS.

Alternative A   Alternative C decreases the pace.

In the Alternative B scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is in December 2015, as in the staff forecast.

This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is the same as that   Alternative B in the January Tealbook.

In the Alternative A scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is pushed out to July 2016, roughly consistent with the reduction in the threshold for the unemployment rate to 5½ percent and the added monetary stimulus from the increased asset purchases in this alternative.

Alternative A provides more policy accommodation than assumed in the staff forecast, suggesting an even stronger outlook.

Growth Rates for the Monetary Base  Date Alternative B Alternative A Alternative C January Alternative B Annual - Q4 to Q4 Quarterly Percent, annual rate Monthly Appendix This appendix presents the assumptions underlying the projections provided in the section titled “Balance Sheet and Monetary Base,” as well as projections for each major component of the balance sheet.

The Tealbook projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative B assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in December 2015.

This date of liftoff is consistent  with the current staff economic forecast and the thresholds described in the January 2013 FOMC  statement, and it is the same as assumed in the balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the January Tealbook.  The projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative A assume the target federal funds rate lifts off in July 2016, roughly consistent with the thresholds and the added monetary stimulus from the increased asset purchases described in the proposed Alternative A statement language and seven months later than in Alternative B.

The projections  for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assume the target federal funds rate lifts off in December 2014, a year earlier than in Alternative B.

ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B  are: o The Committee is assumed to continue purchases of Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month and purchases of agency MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month through June.

The effect is  less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer securities purchases in 2013 and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternatives B and A.
