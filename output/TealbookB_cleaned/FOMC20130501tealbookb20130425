All three would continue to increase the Federal Reserve’s  holdings of agency-backed MBS and longer-term Treasury securities, but at different  rates:  Alternative B would continue securities purchases at the pace that the Committee specified in its March statement ($85 billion per month, in total); Alternative A would increase the pace to a total of $100 billion per month; and Alternative C would expand 60 billion per month.

Alternatives B and C would keep the unemployment rate threshold at 6½ percent, while Alternative A would lower that threshold to 5½ percent and state that the Committee “intends to maintain” a highly accommodative policy for a considerable time (rather than “expects that” a highly accommodative policy will be appropriate for a considerable time, as in Alternatives B .

The draft statement for Alternative B is unchanged from the March statement except for updating the summary of incoming economic information.

In contrast, the  draft statement for Alternative A states that the “pace of improvement in labor market conditions appears to have slowed.   The draft statement for Alternative C offers a more positive characterization of the incoming data, saying that they “confirm” a return to moderate economic growth.

Alternatives A and B acknowledge that “fiscal policy is restraining economic growth,” while Alternative C indicates that fiscal policy “is somewhat more restrictive.   Alternatives B and C indicate that inflation “has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices,” while Alternative A says inflation has been running “below” (rather than “somewhat below”) the longer- run goal.

Alternative B repeats the March statement’s assessment of the medium-term outlook, indicating that, with appropriate policy accommodation, the Committee expects that economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward mandate-consistent levels.

In light of its more positive reading  of the recent economic data, Alternative C states that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth “will proceed at a moderate pace in coming quarters and then pick up,” and that the unemployment rate “will continue to decline” toward mandate-consistent levels.  In contrast, Alternative A says that, “absent further policy accommodation,” economic growth “might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.

With respect to the outlook for inflation, Alternative B maintains the formulation used in March, stating that the Committee “anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.   Alternative A indicates that, without further policy accommodation, medium-term inflation “likely would continue to run below” the Committee’s 2 percent objective, while Alternative C says that inflation “will run close to” the 2 percent objective over the medium term.

Finally, the draft  statements for Alternatives A and B, like the March statement, refer to downside risks to the economic outlook, while Alternative C says that the Committee “sees the risks to both economic growth and inflation as roughly balanced.

A policy decision along the lines of Alternative B would be largely in line with the expectations of market participants and so would probably have little impact on market participants’ expectations about future asset purchases and the target federal funds rate or on market prices.

Moreover,  dealers do not appear to expect any change in the threshold language; consequently, the  5½ percent unemployment threshold in Alternative A would signal a longer period of very low short-term interest rates than dealers currently expect.

If, however, investors read  the statement of Alternative A as indicating that the FOMC has become more pessimistic about the outlook for economic growth and employment than market participants had been assuming, equity prices might not rise or could even decline.

Accordingly, a statement like Alternative C likely would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.

The  directive for Alternative B is unchanged; the drafts for Alternatives A and C suggest modest updates to make the language of the directive consistent with the corresponding post-meeting statement.

The draft directive for Alternative B instructs the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month and to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month.  The draft directive for Alternative A directs the Desk to purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month, and to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $55 billion per month, beginning in May.  The draft directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month, and to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month, beginning in May.

Alternative A increases the pace of purchases beginning in May and continues the purchases somewhat longer, while Alternative C decreases the pace and ends purchases earlier.

In the Alternative B scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is in October 2015, as in the staff forecast in Tealbook Book A.

This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is in the same quarter as   Alternative B in the March Tealbook.

In the Alternative A scenario, the first increase in the target federal funds rate occurs in mid-2016, consistent with the reduction in the threshold for the 6 Temporary reserve draining tools (reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits) are not modeled in any of the scenarios presented.

Under Alternative A, the monetary base increases even more quickly from  2012 to 2014 than under Alternative B as the level of reserve balances climbs in concert with the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.

The Tealbook projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative B assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in October 2015.

In the projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the  first increase in the target federal funds rate occurs in mid-2016, consistent with the reduction in  the threshold for the unemployment rate to 5½ percent and the added monetary stimulus from the   Alternative A statement language.

The  projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assume the target federal funds rate lifts off about one year earlier than in Alternative B.

ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B are: o The Committee is assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and of longer-term Treasury securities by $45 billion per month through June 2013.

The effect is  less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer securities purchases in 2013 and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternatives B and A.
