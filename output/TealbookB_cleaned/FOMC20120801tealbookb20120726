The draft  statements for Alternatives A and B begin by noting that “economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year.   In contrast, Alternative C offers the more upbeat depiction that “the economy has been expanding moderately this year.

Alternatives A and B observe that employment growth has been slow in recent months and note that the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Alternative C does not describe unemployment as elevated; instead, it points to further gains in employment.

Alternatives A and B note, as in the previous statement, that business fixed investment has “continued to advance” but that household spending “appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.   Alternative C simply states that private domestic demand has continued to advance.  Alternatives A and B remark, as in the previous statement, that the housing sector remains depressed, while Alternative C drops this reference.  With respect to prices, Alternatives B and C mention the recent decline in inflation and attribute it mainly to lower prices of crude oil and gasoline.

With  respect to the outlook for inflation, Alternatives A and B retain the language indicating that the Committee expects that inflation over the medium term will “run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate,” while Alternative C includes a projection that inflation over the medium term will run at “about” the mandate-consistent level.

Alternative A offers the Committee a choice between two new large-scale asset purchase programs.

In contrast,  Alternative B and Alternative C would simply continue the MEP through year-end, as announced in June, and maintain the Committee’s existing policies of reinvesting principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS and redeeming maturing Treasury securities.

Alternative A extends the expected date of policy liftoff to at least mid-2015; it also alters the forward guidance by replacing the specific reference to “low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation”—which some may find too negative in tone—with more positive language:  “To support sustained improvement in labor market conditions and to help ensure that inflation is close to its mandate-consistent level over the medium run, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for 1 See the memo “Market Functioning and Limits on Asset Purchases” by staff in the Division of Monetary Affairs at the Board of Governors and in the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for an assessment of the amount of additional Treasury securities and agency MBS that the Federal Reserve could purchase over the next two years without causing a meaningful deterioration in market functioning.

Under Alternative C the Committee could alter the forward guidance either by making the anticipated date of the first increase in the funds rate a year earlier, or by replacing the current forward guidance—including the date—with new language that describes the factors the Committee will consider in deciding when to raise its target for the funds rate.

Finally, Alternative A notes the possibility of a reduction in the remuneration rate on excess reserves from 25 basis points to 15 basis points in order to provide a modest amount of additional policy stimulus.

Consistent with  this assessment, Alternative B ends by stating that the Committee “will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.

A policy decision along the lines of Alternative B would be largely in line with the expectations of market participants.

Even though  its language points to “additional accommodation” without specifically mentioning  LSAPs, the statement of Alternative B would likely lead investors to price in higher odds that additional LSAPs will be implemented by the Committee, perhaps as soon as at the September meeting.

In  particular, Alternative A provides the Committee with an option to expand the balance sheet either through an incremental, open-ended purchase program or through a large, discrete purchase program as in previous LSAP operations.

Thus, a statement along the lines of Alternative A would come as a surprise to investors and  longer-term interest rates would be expected to fall.

Furthermore, participants have priced in significant odds of  additional asset purchases in the near future, and the statement in Alternative C without a change in the expected liftoff date) would be read as a signal that such action was unlikely to be forthcoming, putting further upward pressure on longer-term rates and weighing on equity prices.  Any statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely lead to an appreciation of the dollar.

The scenario corresponding to  Alternative A ends the maturity extension program holdings of longer-term securities by $1 trillion by the end of the third quarter of 2013, and pushes the first increase of the target federal funds rate to mid-2015.

On the liability side of the balance sheet, the forecasted path for reserve balances  for Alternatives B and C remains at same level as in the June Tealbook’s Alternative B.

The level of reserve balances under  Alternative A peaks at 1 trillion LSAP program.

Once exit begins, the monetary                                                    7 To simplify the projections, the prepayment paths for legacy agency MBS holdings and the   Alternative C match those for Alternative B.

The  monetary base under Alternative A expands more rapidly in the near term than under Alternative B due to the LSAP program and then declines at a faster pace beginning in 2015 because of a larger amount of securities redemptions and a larger volume of sales of agency securities.

Under Alternative C, the monetary base   Alternative B because of the assumed earlier liftoff.

The directives for Alternatives B and C would instruct the Desk to leave the total face value of domestic securities in the SOMA about unchanged and to take appropriate steps to complete by the end of December 2012 the MEP of $267 billion that was announced in June.

Alternatives B and C would continue the practice of redeeming maturing Treasury securities at auction, while Alternative A would reinstate the policy of rolling over maturing Treasuries at auction.

The Tealbook projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative  B assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in December 2014, consistent with the forward guidance in the FOMC’s statement that the target federal funds rate is expected to be at exceptionally low levels “at least through late 2014.

The projection for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target federal funds rate lifts off in December 2013, one year earlier than in Alternative B.

The projection for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the  target federal funds rate lifts off in December 2013, one year earlier than in Alternative B.1  The  balance sheet projections assume that no use of short-term draining tools is necessary to achieve  the projected path for the target federal funds rate.2                                                    1 The federal funds rate paths in Alternatives A and C are adjusted to reflect their assumed liftoff dates that are different from the staff forecast.

The projected path of the 10- year Treasury yield in Alternative A is the yield assumed in the July Tealbook staff forecast adjusted for the expectations effect of a later target federal funds rate liftoff (see the box on “Forward Rate Guidance and Policy Expectations” from the January 2012 Tealbook Book B) and for the term premium effect associated with the LSAP program as well as the later liftoff date for the federal funds rate which triggers a later start to asset redemptions and sales.

ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B are: o The FOMC is assumed to continue the MEP as announced in June at its current pace through the end of 2012, directing the Desk to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturity of 6 years to 30 years and to sell or redeem Treasury securities with remaining maturity of approximately 3 years or less.

In Alternatives B and C, where the MEP is assumed 31 billion.

The large-scale asset purchase program in Alternative A would put downward pressure on market interest rates, in particular primary and secondary mortgage rates.

The path of the term premium effect  is a bit more negative than in the June Tealbook Alternative B because of the later liftoff date of the federal funds rate, which implies securities remain out of the hands of the public for longer than in the last Tealbook.

The effect is  more negative than in Alternative B because of the assumed and later lift off date of the federal funds rate.

The effect is  less negative than in Alternative B because of the earlier assumed increase in the federal funds rate which, in turn, leads to earlier asset redemptions and sales that push securities back into the hands of the public sooner.
