The draft statement for Alternative B is largely unchanged from the September statement.

Alternative A contains much the same language except that it describes consumer spending with the words of the September statement: “household spending has continued to advance.   Alternative C offers a somewhat more positive characterization of the data by noting that economic activity has expanded moderately “despite the adverse effects of the drought on agricultural production” and that “private domestic demand has continued to advance.   Moreover, Alternative C says that “employment has increased further” and that “the unemployment rate, though still elevated, has declined.   Alternatives A and B again note “some further signs of improvement” in the housing sector, “albeit from a depressed level,” while Alternative C notes the improvement but not the depressed level.

Alternative C suggests greater concern by stating that inflation “recently picked up, mainly reflecting higher energy prices.

Alternatives A and B also differ from Alternative C in how they communicate the outlook for real activity and employment.  The language in Alternatives A and B is essentially the same as in the September statement, reiterating the Committee’s concern that economic growth might not, on its own, be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.  Alternative B says that growth might not be strong enough unless there is “sufficient” policy accommodation, while the September statement said “further” policy accommodation.  Alternative A retains “further,” which some market participants might read as a signal that the Committee sees a need for more stimulus than will be provided by the flow-based asset purchases that it announced in September.  Alternative C indicates that the Committee expects economic growth to pick up gradually and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will continue to decline; this observation sets the stage for ending asset purchases upon completion of the maturity extension program (MEP) and for moving closer the projected start of policy normalization.

With respect to inflation,  Alternatives A and B say, as in the September statement, that the Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term “likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.   Alternative C says the Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term “will run near its 2 percent objective.

Alternative B maintains both the asset purchases and the language the Committee adopted in September:  Purchases of agency MBS would continue at a pace of $40 billion per month and the MEP would run through year-end; the statement would again indicate that the Committee “will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate” if it does not observe substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions in coming months.  Alternative A would state explicitly that purchases of agency MBS will continue at a pace of $40 billion per month beyond the turn of the year and that the Committee will buy longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month after completing the MEP.  Alternative A also offers new language that is intended to give the public additional information about the factors the Committee will consider in deciding how long to continue asset purchases.  In contrast, Alternative C implies that purchases of both MBS and Treasury securities will stop at year-end.

Alternatives A and B indicate that the Committee anticipates maintaining exceptionally low levels of the funds rate “at least through mid- 2015,” as in the September statement.

Alternative C offers the choice of retaining the words “for a considerable time” or replacing them with “for some time”; it also offers a choice between specifying an earlier anticipated date for the first increase in the federal funds rate or replacing the current forward guidance with new language that describes factors the Committee will consider in deciding when to raise its target for the funds rate but does not include a date.

Thus, the survey suggests that a  statement along the lines of the draft for Alternative B would be in line with market expectations, so it probably would result in little change in interest rates, equity prices, or exchange rates.

In addition, participants may see the  new language in paragraph 4 of the draft statement for Alternative A as desirable, because it signals that the Committee will not end asset purchases at the first signs of improvement in labor market conditions.

Thus, while the  content of a statement along the lines of Alternative A should not greatly surprise investors, the Committee’s decision to make substantial changes in statement language would be a surprise.

If so, they might favor a statement like the   Alternative C that includes paragraph C.

A statement along the lines of Alternative C would greatly surprise market participants and would be interpreted as signaling a significantly faster removal of policy accommodation than investors had expected.

Alternatives A and B include asset purchases that continue beyond the end of the maturity extension program (MEP) and assume that the Committee maintains an exceptionally low federal funds rate until August 2015.  In contrast, Alternative C ends purchases of MBS at the same time as the MEP, at the end of this year, and has the federal funds rate lift off from its lower bound in August 2014.

These purchases from October 2012 through  June 2013 expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about  $750 billion.4  This scenario is roughly consistent with the descriptions of the asset   Alternative B statement if purchases last for about nine months.

In the Alternative B scenario, consistent with the statement language that the federal funds rate is expected to be at exceptionally low levels “at least through mid- 2015,” we assume that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is in August 2015.

These purchases from October 2012 through December 2013 ultimately  expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about $1.25 trillion.11   This scenario is roughly consistent with the descriptions of the asset purchases detailed in   Alternative A statement if purchases last for about fifteen months.

10 Alternative B is similar to the by Board and FRBNY staff.

Remittances are lower, and a deferred asset is accumulated, in the current projection for  Alternative B because the federal funds rate is assumed to rise more steeply than in the previous Tealbook and because a larger fraction of the projected purchases are assumed to be agency MBS, which are subsequently sold during exit.

In this scenario, the federal funds rate   Alternatives B and A.

The draft directives for Alternatives A and B also tell the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency MBS at a pace of about $40 billion per month; they do not specify an end date.  The directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month “until the end of the year.

The Tealbook projections for the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives B and A assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in August 2015, consistent with the forward guidance in the FOMC’s statement that the target federal funds rate is expected to be at exceptionally low levels “at least through mid-2015.

This date of liftoff is consistent with the  current staff economic forecast but is two months later than assumed in the balance sheet   Alternative B in the September Tealbook.

The projection for the scenario  corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target federal funds rate lifts off in August 2014, consistent with the draft statement language “at least through [late 2014 | mid-2014 | late 2013]” and a year earlier than in Alternative B.

ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B  are: o The Committee is assumed to continue its current purchases of MBS through the end of the year, when the MEP concludes, and then continue MBS purchases and additional purchases of Treasury securities through June 2013.

The effect is   Alternative B because of the larger assumed securities purchases.

The effect is  less negative than in Alternative B because there are no additional securities purchases in 2013 and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternative B.
