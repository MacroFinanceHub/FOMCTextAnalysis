Alternatives B and B characterizations of current conditions, the economic outlook, and the risks to that outlook.

However, while Alternative B follows the format that the Committee has used in its recent statements, Alternative B′ follows a somewhat different format that is intended to link the Committee’s policy action—in this case, the continuation of the MEP—more explicitly to its assessment of the outlook for economic growth, employment, and inflation and to the risks associated with its projections for those variables.

However, the B alternatives characterize  employment growth as having slowed in recent months, and Alternative A states that this pace has slowed “notably;” these three alternatives also note that the unemployment rate remains elevated.  In contrast, Alternative C takes a somewhat longer view and points out that the labor market has improved “on balance, this year.

Alternative A and the two B alternatives remark, as in the April statement, that the housing sector remains depressed, while Alternative C drops this reference.

Alternative C downplays the move by saying that inflation has “declined somewhat,” while 1 Alternative B′ takes as its point of departure the changes to the statement proposed in the memo by Presidents Kocherlakota, Plosser and Williams, “A State-Contingent Approach to the FOMC Statement,” distributed to the Committee on June 9, 2012.

Alternative A gives it greater emphasis by saying that inflation has “declined somewhat more than anticipated.

Alternative B downgrades the forecast modestly relative to April by predicting that growth will remain moderate in coming quarters and then will pick up “very gradually,” and that unemployment will decline “only slowly.

Alternative A does not mention a possible pickup in economic growth, and, like Alternative B, states that the Committee expects unemployment to decline “only slowly.  Alternative C retains the language of the April statement, indicating that the Committee “expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually” and that unemployment is therefore likely to “decline gradually.

With respect to the outlook for inflation, Alternatives A and B state that the Committee expects that inflation will “run at or below the rate that it judges consistent with its dual mandate” over the medium term.

Alternative C includes a projection that “inflation over the medium term will run at about” the mandate-consistent level.

Alternative A alters the forward guidance by removing the specific reference to “low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation,” which some may find too negative in tone, and offers the option of extending the expected date of policy liftoff to mid-2015.  Under Alternative C the Committee could alter the forward guidance either by making the anticipated date of the first increase in the funds rate earlier or by replacing the current forward guidance—including the date—with new language describing the factors the Committee considers in setting the forward guidance.

In light of the modest deterioration in the economic outlook summarized in the draft  statement for Alternatives B and B continue the MEP through the end of 2012.

Alternative C would simply complete the existing month.

Those securities are the most liquid, but the production of new agency  MBS securities would likely not be sufficient to conduct a purchase program like that in Alternative A in an amount substantially larger than $500 billion, unless the program were spread over a long enough period of time.

Note that the hypothetical MEP extension  analyzed in the former memo was $400 billion in size, 50 percent larger than the program proposed in  Alternatives B and B Table 1:  Overview of Policy Alternatives for the June 20 FOMC Statement Selected Elements April Statement June Alternatives A B and B′ C Forward Rate Guidance Guidance  at least through  late 2014 at least through late 2014 at least through mid-2015 unchanged at least through late 2014 at least through late 2013 consider range of factors, including actual and projected labor market conditions, medium-term outlook for inflation, & risks to achievement of …objectives Balance Sheet continue its program as announced in September ($400 billion; complete by end of June 2012) complete the program that it announced in September continue to purchase at current pace Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 years and sell or redeem equal amount with remaining maturities of approx.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B OR B Policymakers might view the information received since their last meeting as pointing to both a somewhat weaker modal economic outlook and an increase in downside risks to the outlook.

Accordingly, they may think it appropriate to provide some further  accommodation at this meeting as in Alternative B or B MEP through the end of 2012.

While policymakers may judge that the economic outlook has darkened or that  downside risks have increased, they may view the outlook as significantly more uncertain  than usual and conclude that it would not be appropriate to undertake a sizeable further  expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as in Alternative A unless they see clearer indications that subpar growth is likely to persist.

Such an approach might seem  appropriate if participants thought that a large change in policy would have a particularly  positive effect on business and consumer confidence in such circumstances.6  Moreover, if  policymakers are concerned that additional outright asset purchases could complicate the  Federal Reserve’s ability to exit from its extraordinarily accommodative policy stance at the  appropriate time and pace, they may nonetheless be comfortable with the MEP extension in  Alternatives B and B balance sheet appreciably.

As noted above, Alternatives B and B organization and emphasis of the statement.

Of course, a similar structure could also be applied to   Alternatives A and C.

A policy decision along the lines of Alternatives B and B with the expectations of market participants.

Still, continuing the MEP for another six  months would probably not be viewed as a sizable step by most market participants, so the  market reaction to the extension of the MEP proposed in Alternatives B and B be muted.

Of course, additional asset  purchases and an extension of the forward guidance are not mutually exclusive, and  Alternative A provides the option of moving the expected liftoff date further out in addition to introducing a new LSAP program.

In the Desk’s survey, dealers placed only about 25 percent odds on the Committee  expanding the SOMA portfolio through additional securities purchases at this meeting and  about 50 percent odds on such an expansion sometime within the next year, so a statement   Alternative A would come as something of a surprise to the markets.

Equity prices probably  would increase; however, the more-downbeat characterization of the economic outlook   Alternative A could damp that rise.

Furthermore, participants have  priced in significant odds of additional asset purchases or an extension of the MEP at this  meeting or in the near future, and the statement in Alternative C in the expected liftoff date) would be read as a signal that such action was unlikely to be forthcoming, putting further upward pressure on longer-term rates and dragging equity prices lower.  Any statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely lead to an appreciation of the dollar.

The  first scenario incorporates a continuation of the maturity extension program (MEP) that is   Alternatives B and B’.

For the balance sheet scenario that corresponds to Alternatives B and B’, the Committee is assumed to continue the MEP at its current pace through the end of 2012 instead of ending it at the end of this month as scheduled.

3  Compared to Alternative B from the April Tealbook, the size of the balance sheet normalizes about half a year later because the continuation of the MEP leads to the accumulation of more longer-dated Treasury securities, which mature and roll off the portfolio later than the short-dated securities they replace, and hence the balance sheet shrinks somewhat less rapidly.

onward, under all scenarios, the paths for total assets in the current projections are close to   Alternative B path in the April Tealbook.

Normalization of the size of the balance sheet occurs in February 2018,   Alternatives B and B’.

On the liability side of the balance sheet, the forecasted path for reserve balances for  Alternatives B and B’ remains at roughly the same Tealbook’s Alternative B until the exit strategy begins.

Thereafter, and until the balance  sheet normalizes in size, the longer-maturity portfolio under Alternatives B and B’ for this meeting contracts more slowly than projected under Alternative B from the April Tealbook, and therefore implies that the level of reserve balances is, for some time, higher than in the previous Tealbook.  The level of reserves under Alternative A peaks at 14 If the first increase in the target federal funds rate was pushed later, the date of normalization would likewise be delayed.

15 To simplify the projections, the prepayment paths for legacy agency MBS holdings and the   Alternative C match those for Alternative B.

Under  Alternative C, reserve balances start to decline earlier than in Alternative B because the exit from exceptionally accommodative policy is assumed to begin sooner.

In the scenario corresponding to Alternatives B and B’, the monetary base is roughly flat from 2012 to 2014, given the trajectory for the portfolio.

The  monetary base under Alternative A expands more rapidly in the near term than under Alternative B due to the MBS LSAP and then declines at a faster pace beginning in 2014 because of a larger amount of securities redemptions and a larger volume of sales.

The  resumption in the expansion of the monetary base in Alternative A begins in the third quarter of 2018.

Under Alternative C, the monetary base begins to contract slightly sooner   Alternative B because of the assumed earlier liftoff.

The directives for Alternative C would instruct the Desk to leave the total face value of domestic securities in the SOMA about unchanged and to take appropriate steps to complete by the end of June 2012 the $400 billion maturity extension program that was announced last September.

Under Alternatives B and B maturity extension program in the amount of about $267 billion from July 2012 through December 2012.

Each of the draft directives would also instruct the Desk to continue the  current practice of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency MBS in  agency MBS, and Alternatives A and C would also continue the practice of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Alternatives B and B of rolling of maturing Treasuries while the maturity extension program was in place, to allow a portion of the SOMA’s holdings of short-term Treasury securities to be redeemed as a part of this program.

Alternative B or B' The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.

This date of liftoff is the same as that used  in the April Tealbook for the Alternative A1, A2, and B balance sheet projections, but later than  that assumed in the June Tealbook staff forecast.2  The projection for the scenario corresponding   Alternative C assumes the target rate lifts off in October 2013.

ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternatives B and B’ are: o Over the nine months beginning in October 2011, the FOMC is assumed to purchase $400 billion in par value of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of six years or more and sell the same par amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three years or less, as part of its ongoing maturity extension program .

In addition, the  Committee is expected to complete the MEP in June and, unlike in Alternatives B and B’, is assumed to follow current reinvestment policies.

The large-scale asset purchase program in Alternative A would put downward pressure on market interest rates, in particular primary and secondary mortgage rates.

TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS6   Under Alternatives B and B’, the current staff estimates of the contemporaneous term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury note is negative 71 basis points.

The path of the term  premium effect is more negative than in the April Tealbook Alternative B because of the assumed continuation of the MEP.

Under Alternative A, the term premium effect is a bit larger than in Alternatives B and B’, at negative 77 basis points.

 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect is somewhat smaller than under  Alternatives B and B’, at negative 53 basis points.
