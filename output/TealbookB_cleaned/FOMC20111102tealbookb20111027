Alternative C announces a reduction by half in the size of the maturity extension program and an intention to complete it sooner, by the end of March 2012 (which would involve a moderate slowing of the pace of purchases and .

Alternative B makes no substantive changes to the Committee’s forward guidance, keeping the specification that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate “at least through mid-2013.

When providing information on the timing of liftoff, both Alternatives B and C also offer the possibility of changing the language of the conditional guidance so that it refers to a specific number of quarters into the future rather than a particular date.

All of the alternatives note that  household spending has picked up in recent months and also the continuing weakness in the  labor market; the tone of Alternative C is slightly more encouraging with respect to economic developments.

Regarding inflation, Alternatives A1 and A2 state that it “has moderated” since  earlier in the year, while Alternative B repeats the language of the September statement, saying that it “appears to have moderated.   Alternative  C says that inflation appears to have moderated “only somewhat.

Alternatives A1, A2, and B note that the  Committee consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline “only gradually;”  Alternative C offers a more positive tone by omitting “only” from this phrase.

Alternatives A1,  A2, and B continue to highlight downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in  global financial markets, although Alternative B no longer characterizes these risks as “significant.   Alternative C drops the reference to downside risks.

Alternative C modifies this projection to “levels consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate.

Thus, they may find the early   Alternative C to be premature.

If so, they may see merit in the option in Alternative B is also included in Alternative C) that indicates that the federal funds rate is likely to remain in its exceptionally low range “for at least the next six to seven quarters.

A statement along the lines of Alternative B would be broadly in line with market expectations.

Thus, any reaction in short-term interest rates to the forward guidance contained in  Alternative B would likely be muted.

Moreover, dealers placed low odds on any change in the  Committee’s asset-purchase programs at this meeting, so Alternative B would also be unlikely to result in much change in longer-term interest rates.

A statement like that in Alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market participants, who appear to be expecting no change in the policy stance at this meeting and who seem to place very low odds on the maturity extension program not being completed as announced in September.

4 It is possible that the communication strategy in Alternative A1 would induce the path of the 10-year   Alternative B through the medium term.

Likewise,  sales of agency securities under Alternative C commence in mid-2013, also earlier than in the baseline, and these sales also last for five years.

8 The prepayment paths for agency MBS holdings and premiums calculations in Alternative C are based on the interest rate path used in Alternatives A1 and B.

The directive for Alternative C would instruct the Desk to reduce the amount of these purchases and sales to a total level of $200 billion each and to conduct these operations by the end of March 2012.

The Tealbook projections for the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives A1, A2, and B  assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in September 2014, consistent with the  monetary policy path in the Tealbook extension derived from the outcome-based rule, while the  projection for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target rate lifts off in January 2013.
