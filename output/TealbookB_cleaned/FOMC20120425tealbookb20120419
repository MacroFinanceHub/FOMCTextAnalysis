With the same aim in mind, Alternatives A and C offer ways to modify the forward guidance.

The draft statements for Alternatives A and B begin with the same words as the March statement:  “Information received … suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately.   Alternative C offers the more upbeat depiction that “the economic recovery has continued to strengthen.   Alternatives A and B observe that labor market conditions have improved in recent months, but also note that the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Alternative C does not describe unemployment as elevated; instead, after citing the improvement in labor markets, it points to the expansion in private payrolls in recent months.  Alternative A characterizes the housing sector as depressed; Alternatives B and C offer two ways to indicate that the sector has shown some improvement but is still depressed.  With respect to prices, Alternatives A and B observe that inflation “has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline.   Alternative C puts more emphasis on the effects of the run-up in oil and gas prices by saying that “sizable increases in the prices of crude oil and gasoline have pushed up inflation somewhat.

Alternative B states that the Committee expects economic growth “to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually, supported by highly accommodative monetary policy.  As before, Alternative B says that the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate “will decline gradually” toward levels it considers consistent with the dual mandate.  Alternative C embodies a stronger forecast; it states that the Committee expects that economic growth will pick up over time, and that the unemployment rate “will move appreciably closer, over the next few years,” to levels judged consistent with the dual mandate.  Alternative A envisions less strength; it says that “absent further policy stimulus, economic growth would be unacceptably slow” and unemployment would decline “only very gradually.

With respect to the outlook for inflation, Alternative B observes that the increase in prices of crude oil and gasoline earlier this year “is expected to affect inflation only temporarily,” and that “the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.

While Alternative C also says that the increase in oil and gasoline prices is expected to affect inflation only temporarily, it sends a different message about the medium-run outlook for inflation by stating “the Committee anticipates that, with appropriate monetary policy, inflation over the medium term will run close to the rate that it judges most consistent with its mandate.

While the draft statement for Alternative A maintains the current target range for the federal funds rate and reiterates that the anticipated period of exceptionally low federal funds rates extends at least through late 2014, it offers the public more information than Alternative B about the types of economic information that will inform the Committee’s future policy decisions.  Alternative C maintains the current target range and completes the existing $400 billion MEP, but it alters the forward guidance either by pulling forward the anticipated date of the first increase in the federal funds rate or by replacing the current forward guidance—including the date—with new, exit-oriented, language.

A statement like Alternative B would be largely in line with the expectations of financial market participants.

of Alternative A incorporates a discrete $500 billion agency MBS purchase program spread over 12 months, the Committee could instead choose to implement an incremental, open-ended purchase program by specifying an initial monthly rate of purchases—perhaps $40 to $45 billion per month—and stating that it would adjust the pace of purchases and determine the ultimate size of the program as needed to foster its objectives.

A statement along the lines of Alternative A would surprise financial market participants.

Equity prices probably would increase; however, the downbeat  characterization of the economic outlook contained in paragraph 2 of Alternative A could damp that rise or even result in a drop in equity prices.

Alternatively, as in  paragraph 3.2 of Alternative C, the Committee could state that, in light of the improved  economic outlook, it now anticipates that economic conditions will warrant a  substantially shorter period of exceptionally low interest rates than it previously  expected.3    A statement along the lines of Alternative C would surprise financial market participants.

LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE  The staff has prepared four scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet:    Alternative A and one each for Alternative B and Alternative C.

Over a nine-month period, the  Desk would sell $400 billion (par value) of Treasury securities with remaining maturities                                                    1 This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is the same as in the March Alternative B balance sheet projection, but later than the January 2014 date assumed in the staff forecast.

On the liability side of the balance sheet, the forecasted path for reserve balances   Alternative B is roughly unchanged from the previous Tealbook’s baseline.

Annual - Q4 to Q4  Monthly Growth Rates for the Monetary Base  Date Alternative B Alternative A1 Percent, annual rate Alternative C Memo: March Tealbook Quarterly Alternative A2 DEBT, BANK CREDIT, AND MONEY FORECASTS Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand at an annual rate of about 4¾ percent in the first half of the year, driven by a significant expansion in federal government debt and a modest rise in private nonfinancial debt.

The directives for Alternatives B and C would instruct the Desk to leave the total face value of domestic securities in the SOMA about unchanged and to take appropriate steps to complete by the end of June 2012 the $400 billion maturity extension program that was announced last September.  The directive for Alternative A also would instruct the Desk to complete the maturity extension program that was announced last September.

This date of liftoff is the same as that used in the March Tealbook for  the Alternative A and B balance sheet projections, but later than that assumed in the April Tealbook staff forecast.   The projection for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target rate lifts off in July 2013.

The balance sheet projections assume that no use of short- term draining tools is necessary to achieve the projected path for the federal funds rate.3  ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B are: o Over the nine months beginning in October 2011, the FOMC is assumed to purchase $400 billion in par value of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of six years or more and sell the same par amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three years or less.

As a result, although the par value of securities holdings remains constant  under the current MEP in the baseline and Alternative C, as well as in the extended MEP  in A1, premiums associated with securities, and hence total assets, will have risen on net  59 billion in Alternatives B and C by the end of this program and a bit more in Alternative A1.
