Alternative B would continue purchases of agency-backed MBS and longer-term Treasury securities at the monthly rates that the Committee specified in its December statement.  Alternative A would increase the pace of securities 100 billion per month.  In contrast, Alternative C would substantially reduce the pace of purchases; it also would indicate that the Committee expects to reduce the pace of purchases further in coming months if the economy develops as anticipated.

Alternatives A and B would repeat the “stopping condition” that the FOMC first used in its September statement:  The Committee will continue its securities purchases until a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market is achieved in a context of price stability.  Alternative C would state that the Committee expects to end purchases by midyear.

Alternatives B and C would keep the unemployment threshold at 6½ percent, as in December, while Alternative A would lower that threshold to 5½ percent.

Alternatives A and B attribute the slowing “in large part” to transitory factors; Alternative C implicitly attributes all of the slowing to transitory factors.  Alternatives A and B observe that employment continued to expand at a moderate pace, but that the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Alternative C acknowledges that the unemployment rate is still elevated, but emphasizes its substantial decline during the past year.

The second paragraphs of Alternatives B and C reinforce this message by stating the Committee’s expectation that economic growth “will proceed at a moderate pace” (in Alternative B) or “will return to a moderate pace” (in Alternative C), and that the unemployment rate will decline toward levels judged consistent with the dual mandate.

Alternative B conditions that projection on “sufficient policy accommodation” while Alternative C implies that the Committee expects the recovery to be strong enough to warrant reducing the pace of asset purchases.  Alternative A adopts a more tentative tone, stating that “the Committee judges that, without additional policy accommodation, economic growth likely would not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.

In response to the improved situation in European financial  markets, Alternatives B and C note some easing of strains in global financial markets; Alternative C also points to a reduction in downside risks to the outlook, while Alternative B indicates they remain significant.  In contrast, Alternative A not only says that downside risks remain significant, it adds a reference to risks from “unresolved fiscal issues.

With respect to inflation, Alternative B repeats the words of the December statement: “The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.   In contrast, Alternative A indicates that medium-term inflation likely will be “somewhat below” its 2 percent objective while Alternative C says that inflation likely will run “close to” its 2 percent objective over the medium term.

Thus, a statement along the lines of  Alternative B would not surprise market participants and seems likely to generate little market reaction; it also would be unlikely to alter market participants’ views on the likely pace or cumulative amount of future asset purchases.

29 of 59 to rise—and, given the Committee’s stated exit principles, of the time at which asset sales  might begin—and thus help to reduce longer-term interest rates and make broader  financial conditions more accommodative.3      An announcement along the lines of Alternative A certainly would surprise market participants.

Longer-term real interest rates likely would  decline if participants responded to a statement like Alternative A by increasing their projections of the cumulative increase in Federal Reserve securities holdings and flattening their expected path for the federal funds rate.

However, if investors  read the statement of Alternative A as indicating that the FOMC now has a gloomier outlook for growth and employment, equity prices would rise less or could even decline.

With the current staff forecast as  the underlying baseline, the simulation of Alternative A with a 5½ percent threshold for unemployment and a 2½ percent threshold for projected inflation (and with securities purchases at a pace of $100 billion per month through the middle of this year, followed by tapering to zero at year-end) produces outcomes for unemployment and inflation that are quite close to the constrained optimal control paths shown in the final set of charts in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of this Tealbook.

A statement like of Alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market participants and might well be interpreted as signaling a significantly earlier removal of policy accommodation than investors had expected.

Alternative B continues purchases at the monthly rates that the Committee specified in its December statement, $45 billion per month of longer-term 40 billion per month of agency MBS.  Alternative A increases the pace of securities purchases, while Alternative C decreases the pace.

In the Alternative B scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is in December 2015, as in the staff forecast.

This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is two months later   Alternative B in the December Tealbook.

In the Alternative A scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is pushed out to July 2016, consistent with the reduction in the threshold for the unemployment rate to 5½ percent in the statement language.

Alternative A provides more policy accommodation than in the staff forecasts, suggesting an even stronger outlook.

The draft directive for Alternative B instructs the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency MBS at a pace of about $40 billion per month and to continue 45 billion per month.

The  draft directive for Alternative A directs the Desk to purchase additional agency MBS at a pace of about $45 billion per month and to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a 55 billion per month.  The draft directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to purchases agency MBS at a pace of about $20 billion per month and to purchase 25 billion per month.

The Tealbook projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative B assume that the target federal funds rate begins to increase in December 2015.

This date of liftoff is consistent  with the current staff economic forecast and the thresholds described in the December 2012  FOMC statement, and it is two months later than assumed in the balance sheet projections for  Alternative B in the December Tealbook.

The projections for the scenario corresponding to  Alternative A assume the target federal funds rate lifts off in July 2016, consistent with the thresholds described in the proposed Alternative A statement language and seven months later than in Alternative B.  The projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assume the target federal funds rate lifts off in December 2014, a year earlier than in Alternative B.

51 of 59 ASSETS  Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt  Securities   The assumptions under Alternative B  are: o The Committee is assumed to continue purchases of Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month and purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month through June.

The effect is  less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer securities purchases in 2013 and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternatives B and A.
