Monetary Policy Strategies
The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federal funds rate from six policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, and the nominal income targeting rule.  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
the near-term.  (Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations of the 
rules are discussed below.)  As shown in the left-hand columns, four of the six rules keep 
the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound over the next two quarters.  The Taylor 
(1993) rule, which puts relatively little weight on the output gap, prescribes a federal 
funds rate of about 1 percent for the first quarter of 2014 and almost 1½ percent the 
following quarter.  The first-difference rule, which responds to the expected change in the 
output gap, prescribes increasing the federal funds rate to about ½ percent over the same 
time frame.1
The right-hand columns display the near-term prescriptions in the absence of the 
lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.2   For the first two quarters of 2014, the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the outcome-based rule prescribe federal funds rates near 
zero.  In contrast, the Taylor (1999) rule, which does not include an interest-rate 
smoothing term and thus responds more strongly to the staff’s estimates of current 
inflation and the current output gap, prescribes a moderately negative value for the 
federal funds rate in the first quarter of 2014; however, the rule then specifies moving the 
funds rate up toward zero in the second quarter of 2014.  The nominal income targeting 
rule responds to the current estimate of the output gap and to the cumulative shortfall of 
inflation from the assumed 2 percent target since the end of 2007.  Reflecting these

features, this rule calls for significantly more negative values of the federal funds rate 
than the other rules in the near term.
The unconstrained near-term prescriptions for most rules are largely unchanged 
from the October Tealbook, reflecting offsetting effects from revisions in the staff’s near-
term estimates of inflation and the output gap.3  As shown in the lower left panel, the 
staff’s output gap estimates for the next few years are slightly narrower than before, in 
response to a higher estimate of the current level of real GDP as well as a slightly 
stronger medium-term forecast for growth.  As shown in the lower right panel, the staff’s 
estimate for core PCE inflation is a littler lower for the next six quarters, and is mostly 
unchanged thereafter.
The top panel of the first exhibit also reports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r*, which is generated using the FRB/US model after adjusting it to replicate 
the staff’s economic forecast.  The short-run r* estimate of the equilibrium real federal 
funds rate corresponds to the rate that would, if maintained, return output to potential in 
12 quarters.  Reflecting the narrower output gap in the staff’s medium-term projection, 
the r* estimate for the current Tealbook has increased slightly, to about 1¼ percent.  
The current estimate of r* is now about 20 basis points below the real federal funds rate.
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model that incorporate endogenous responses of 
inflation and the output gap implied by having the federal funds rate follow the paths 
prescribed by the different policy rules, under the assumption that the federal funds rate is 
constrained by the effective lower bound and without regard to the Committee’s 
thresholds related to inflation and the unemployment rate.4  (Alternative policy rule 
simulations that incorporate the thresholds are discussed below.)  Each rule is applied 
from the first quarter of 2014 onward, under the assumptions that financial market 
participants as well as price- and wage-setters believe that the FOMC will follow that rule
strongly to inflation rather than the output gap, as well as the first-difference rule, which places equal 
weight on expected inflation and the expected change in the output gap, are about 15 basis points lower 
than in the October Tealbook.

and that agents fully understand and anticipate the implications of the rule for future real 
activity, inflation, and interest rates.
The exhibit also displays the implications of following the Tealbook baseline 
policy.  This policy keeps the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound of 12½ basis 
points as long as the unemployment rate is above 6½ percent and average inflation five to 
eight quarters hence is projected to be less than 2½ percent.  Once either of these 
variables crosses its threshold value, the federal funds rate follows the prescription of the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  As in the October Tealbook, the Tealbook baseline rule 
implies departure from the effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015, one 
quarter after the unemployment rate drops below 6½ percent.  The federal funds rate then 
steadily increases about ¼ percentage point per quarter over the next three years, 
reaching 3½ percent by the end of 2018.  The unemployment rate reaches the staff’s 
estimate of the long-term natural rate of unemployment of 5¼ percent by the beginning 
of 2017.  Headline inflation rises only slowly, reaching 2 percent by early 2020.
Without thresholds, most of the policy rules call for tightening to begin earlier 
than under the Tealbook baseline.  Four of the rules put the real federal funds rate 
appreciably above the path implied by the baseline forecast, policy settings that result in 
higher unemployment and lower inflation than the baseline through most of the decade. 
The prescription of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule is nearly identical to the baseline.  Only 
the nominal income targeting rule prescribes a later tightening than that in the Tealbook 
baseline.  This rule keeps the federal funds rate at the lower bound until the third quarter 
of 2016 and generates a real federal funds rate persistently below baseline for the rest of 
the decade, thereby inducing stronger future real activity and higher future inflation.
The results presented in these and subsequent simulations depend importantly on 
the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to the simulated rule in the future and that 
private sector expectations fully incorporate the paths for the federal funds rate, real 
activity, and inflation implied by the rule.  These assumptions play a particularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targeting rule, which is associated with outcomes 
in which inflation runs above the 2 percent long-run goal for some years, even after the 
output gap is closed.
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations with Thresholds,” displays dynamic 
simulations in which the policy rules are subject to the thresholds that the Committee 
adopted in December 2012.  For each of the rules, the thresholds are imposed by keeping

the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound of 12½ basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6½ percent and average inflation five to eight quarters hence 
is projected to be less than 2½ percent.  Financial market participants and price- and 
wage-setters are assumed to understand that the Committee will switch to the specified 
rule when one of the threshold conditions is satisfied and to view this switch as 
permanent and fully credible.  In each of the simulations discussed below, crossing the 
unemployment threshold is the catalyst for switching to the specified rule.
As in the October Tealbook, the imposition of the thresholds leads to a departure 
of the federal funds rate from the effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015 for 
most rules.5  In most cases, this timing is the same as under the Tealbook baseline; 
compared to the case without thresholds, the augmented rules would thus postpone the 
departure of the federal funds rate from the effective lower bound by two quarters or 
more.  Because the nominal income targeting rule does not prescribe raising the federal 
funds rate above its effective lower bound until after the unemployment rate falls below 
6½ percent, imposing the thresholds on the nominal income targeting rule does not alter 
the date for this rule’s prescribed departure from the lower bound.
The threshold strategy delays the departure of the federal funds rate from the 
effective lower bound by five quarters under the Taylor (1993) and by three quarters 
under the first-difference rules.  As a result, the unemployment rate declines more 
rapidly, and inflation is a touch higher, when the thresholds are imposed on these rules.  
The threshold strategy only postpones departure from the effective lower bound by a 
quarter or two under the Taylor (1999), the inertial Taylor (1999), and the outcome-based 
rules, generating little difference in macroeconomic outcomes from the same rules 
without the thresholds.6
The fourth exhibit, “Constrained versus Unconstrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares the optimal control simulations derived using this Tealbook’s baseline forecast 
with those reported in the October Tealbook.7  Policymakers are assumed to place equal

described in footnote 3.  The simulated policies do not incorporate thresholds.

weights on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, on 
keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  The optimal control 
concept presented here corresponds to a commitment policy under which policymakers 
make choices today that effectively constrain policy choices in future periods.
The federal funds rate prescriptions derived from optimal control simulations in 
which policy is constrained by the effective lower bound are more accommodative than 
the staff’s baseline forecast.  In the simulations, the optimal federal funds rate departs 
from the lower bound in the first quarter of 2016, nearly a year later than in the staff’s 
baseline forecast, and rises only to 2½ percent by early 2018.  Over the medium-term, the 
constrained optimal control path for the funds rate is almost identical to the path shown in 
the October Tealbook.  Beyond 2017, the optimal control prescriptions for the current 
Tealbook are somewhat less accommodative than those shown in the October Tealbook.
By generating a lower path for the real federal funds rate than in the staff’s 
baseline outlook, the constrained optimal control policy promotes a stronger economic 
recovery.8  In particular, the unemployment rate reaches the staff’s estimate of the long-
term natural rate of unemployment of 5¼ percent by the last half of 2016, two quarters 
earlier than in the staff’s baseline forecast.  Inflation runs slightly above the staff’s 
baseline forecast, although it does not reach the 2 percent objective until the beginning of 
2019.
In the absence of a lower-bound constraint, the optimal federal funds rate would 
reach a minimum of about negative ¾ percent in the first quarter of 2015 and turn 
positive only by the first quarter of 2016, with the real rate turning positive only in the 
third quarter of 2017.  The unconstrained policy would bring down the unemployment 
rate a bit faster than the constrained policy but lead to a nearly identical path for inflation.  
This similarity in inflation outcomes arises because inflation has a low sensitivity to 
resource slack in the FRB/US model.
rate shown in the upper-right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federal funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the real interest rate for this illustrative purpose 
because it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expectations than does a four-quarter moving 
average of headline inflation.

The fifth exhibit, “A Comparison of Optimal Control Policies and the Baseline 
Policy Rule under Alternative Unemployment Rate Thresholds,” compares results from 
optimal control simulations against prescriptions from the staff’s baseline rule subject to 
alternative unemployment rate thresholds.
The optimal control simulations discussed above were derived from a 
commitment policy under which policymakers make choices today that effectively 
constrain policy choices in future periods.  The fifth exhibit displays results that use an 
alternative optimality concept—discretion—under which policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan that requires them to make future choices that would be 
suboptimal at that future time.  The discretion concept limits policymakers’ ability to 
influence private-sector expectations regarding the federal funds rate and other variables.  
Instead, the private sector knows that future Committees will always reoptimize without 
regard for past policymakers’ promises, and this behavior leads to less stimulative policy 
in current circumstances.  Under discretion, the Committee raises the federal funds rate 
two quarters sooner and keeps monetary policy somewhat less accommodative than 
under commitment, so the unemployment rate does not fall as much below its natural rate 
and inflation does not rise above the 2 percent objective.  Optimal control under 
discretion generates a persistently lower path for the federal funds rate than the baseline 
until mid-2018; afterwards, however, the discretion path for the federal funds rate is a 
little higher than in the baseline.  On net, the overall stance of the discretionary policy 
thus turns out to be only slightly more accommodative than in the baseline, and leads to 
an only marginally more speedy recovery in the unemployment rate and very similar 
outcomes for inflation.
The exhibit also displays results from a dynamic simulation of the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule with an unemployment threshold of 6 percent and an unchanged inflation 
threshold.9  In contrast, under the Tealbook baseline projection the federal funds rate 
follows the prescription of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule once the unemployment rate 
falls under 6½ percent.  Lowering the unemployment threshold to 6 percent keeps the 
federal funds rate at its effective lower bound for three quarters longer than in the
by keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound of 12½ basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above the designated threshold—now at 6 percent—and average inflation five to 
eight quarters hence is projected to be less than 2½ percent.  As before, crossing the unemployment 
threshold is the catalyst for switching to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule in the simulations considered here.

baseline case; this extra accommodation leads to a somewhat more rapid improvement in 
the labor market than in the baseline.10  The alternative threshold strategy for the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule generates outcomes for unemployment and inflation that are very 
similar to those obtained from optimal control under discretion.  Under the alternative 
unemployment threshold, the baseline rule prescribes the first increase in the funds rate to 
occur a little later than in the case of optimal control under discretion; subsequently, the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule calls for swifter funds rate increases.  As a result, both policies 
imply very similar paths for longer-term rates (not shown), in turn generating similar 
trajectories for the unemployment rate and inflation.

Po lic y  Rules Used  in  "Mo n et a r y  Po lic y  St r a t e g ie s"
The table below gives the expressions for the selected policy rules used in "Monetary 
Policy Strategies." In the table, \( R_t\) denotes the effective nominal federal funds rate for quarter \( t\), 
while the right-hand-side variables include the staff  s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE 
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead (\( \pi_t\) and \( \pi_{t+3|t}\)), the output gap estimate 
for the current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast (\( gap_t\) and \( gap_{t+1|t}\)), and the forecast 
of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap (\( \Deltâ4gap_{t+3|t}\)). The value of 
policymakers’ long-run inflation objective, denoted \( \pî*\), is 2 percent. The nominal income 
targeting rule responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between 
nominal income \( yn_t\) (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value \( yn̂*_t\) (100 
times the log of target nominal GDP). Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff  s 
estimate of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; 
subsequently, target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff  s 
estimate of potential GDP.

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured prominently in recent analysis by Board staff.1 The outcome- 
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q1-2006:Q4. The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run real interest rate of 2 percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model.2 The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules and the long-run

intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are set at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).
Near-term prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a 
right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated 
outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—the lines denoted “Previous 
Tealbook Outlook” report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap, while using the same lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions 
computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this 
lagged funds rate value is set equal to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous 
quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late 
in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for 
each of these rules, including those that use the “Previous Tealbook Outlook,” is set equal to the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules 
use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate appears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The concept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarters using an output projection from FRB/US, the 
staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends on a very 
broad array of economic factors, some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s 
exogenous variables.  The memo item in the exhibit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of 
r*, which is generated after the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted 
so that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine 
the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast.
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE 
price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date.
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line labeled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

Monetary Policy Alternatives
This Tealbook presents three policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  Alternative B reduces monthly purchases of both MBS and 
Treasury securities by modest amounts, signals that further reductions are likely, and 
enhances the forward guidance for the federal funds rate by incorporating a qualitative 
description of the Committee’s likely policy approach after the 6½ percent 
unemployment threshold is reached.  Alternative C announces larger reductions in 
monthly purchases, also signals that further reductions are likely, and maintains 
October’s forward guidance.  This alternative includes an option to convert the current 
“flow-based” asset purchase program to a “fixed-size” program that would end in June.  
Alternative A makes the stance of policy more accommodative than the other alternatives 
by augmenting the forward guidance along several dimensions while maintaining the 
pace of asset purchases and indicating that the Committee is not likely to reduce the pace 
of its purchases in the near term.
In summarizing recent economic developments, Alternatives B and C state that 
economic activity is expanding at a “moderate” pace and that labor market conditions 
have shown “further improvement,” while Alternative A characterizes the expansion as 
“modest” and cites “some” further improvement in labor market conditions.  All of the 
alternatives say that fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, but Alternatives B and 
C add that the extent of restraint “may be” and “appears to be” diminishing, respectively.  
Alternative B says that inflation has been running “below” the Committee’s longer-run 
objective; Alternative C uses “somewhat below” and Alternative A says “well below.”  
All three alternatives note that longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
In characterizing the economic outlook, Alternatives A and B say the Committee 
expects that economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment 
rate “will gradually decline” toward its mandate-consistent level; Alternative C uses “will 
continue to decline” and cites growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  With 
respect to risks to the outlook, Alternative A says the Committee continues to see 
“modest downside risks,” Alternative B offers a choice of describing the risks as “having 
diminished” or as “roughly balanced,” and Alternative C uses “roughly balanced.”  All of 
the alternatives state that the Committee recognizes the risks associated with inflation 
running persistently below 2 percent.  Alternatives B and C indicate that the Committee

anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term; 
Alternative B adds that the Committee “will monitor inflation developments carefully.”  
Alternative A signals less confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent by saying that 
the Committee “will monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation 
is moving back toward its objective.”
With respect to balance sheet policies, Alternatives B and C indicate that 
cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook 
for labor market conditions justify a downward adjustment in the pace of asset purchases, 
with Alternative B making a modest reduction (to $35 billion per month for agency MBS 
and to $40 billion per month for Treasury securities) and Alternative C making a more 
substantial reduction (to $30 billion per month for agency MBS and $30 billion per 
month for Treasury securities).  Both of these alternatives specify that “the Committee 
will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases” at future meetings, but note that asset 
purchases are state contingent and are not on a preset course.  Alternative C also provides 
the Committee with another option for reducing the pace of asset purchases under which 
the Committee states the total amount of purchases in 2014 and gives a June 2014 end 
date for the purchase program.  Alternative A instead indicates that a cut in the pace of 
purchases is not imminent, saying that progress toward the Committee’s objectives is 
“not yet sufficient to warrant” such an adjustment.
Regarding forward guidance for the federal funds rate, all of the alternatives 
maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the funds rate and the 2½ percent “ceiling” 
threshold for projected inflation.  Alternatives B and C also maintain the 6½ percent 
threshold for the unemployment rate, while Alternative A provides the option of lowering 
this threshold to either 6 or 5½ percent.  Alternative C retains the other elements of the 
forward guidance used in the October statement, saying that in determining how long to 
maintain a highly accommodative policy stance the Committee “will also consider other 
information” and that it will take a balanced approach when it begins to remove policy 
accommodation.  Alternative B adds language strengthening the forward guidance, 
saying that the Committee expects to keep the target federal funds rate low “well past the 
time” that the unemployment threshold is crossed.  Alternative A augments the forward 
guidance even more:  In addition to stating that the Committee will consider a “broad 
range of indicators” in determining how long to keep the target rate low, Alternative A 
says the Committee “expects to be patient” and anticipates keeping the federal funds rate 
“below its longer-run normal value for a considerable time.”  The following table 
summarizes key elements of the three alternative statements, followed by complete drafts 
of the statements and arguments for each alternative.

billion to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of [ $30 ] 
billion per month, and also will add [ $180 ] billion to its holdings of longer-term 
Treasury securities at a pace of [ $30 ] billion per month, bringing the total

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B
Policymakers might view the economy’s recent performance as broadly 
consistent with the modal outlook that underlay their discussions of the contingent plan 
for asset purchases outlined in the post-meeting press conference in June and in 
subsequent public communications.  In particular, policymakers may judge that the 
moderate expansion in economic activity, taken together with the solid gains in payroll 
employment and the decline in the unemployment rate observed over the intermeeting 
period, help to confirm that there has been considerable cumulative progress toward 
maximum employment and appreciable improvement in the outlook for labor market 
conditions since the inception of the Committee’s current asset purchase program.  They 
might point to recent data, including the November retail sales report, suggesting that 
consumer spending is accelerating in the near term and thus see a high likelihood of the 
improvement in the labor market being sustained as the fiscal headwinds recede and a 
stronger stock market and ongoing recovery in housing prices support stronger economic 
growth.  They therefore may prefer to announce, as in Alternative B, a modest reduction 
in the pace of asset purchases in December and to state that further reductions are likely 
at future meetings if improvements in the economy and labor market continue about as 
expected.  However, policymakers also may be concerned that a reduction in the pace of 
purchases could be viewed by market participants as a signal that the Committee has 
generally become less inclined to provide accommodation and worry that the 
announcement of such a reduction could lead to a shift in expectations for the federal 
funds rate such as the one that occurred last summer.  In order to forestall an undesirable 
increase in long-term interest rates, and to help foster a return of inflation to its longer-
run objective, they may therefore want to clarify and strengthen the forward guidance for 
the federal funds rate.
Some policymakers may be concerned that the new forward guidance language in 
paragraph B.5 could limit the Committee’s flexibility in the future, risking an undesirably 
large increase in inflation over the medium run or even a rise in longer-term inflation 
expectations.  They may also worry that maintaining very low rates for as long as 
suggested by the forward guidance could lead to excessive risk-taking in the financial 
sector (see the accompanying box, “Financial Stability Considerations”).  For similar 
reasons, they may prefer a larger reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  However, 
increases in medium- and longer-term interest rates since the middle of the year appear to 
have reduced risk-taking at least to some extent by spurring market participants to pare

FINANCIAL STABILITY CONSIDERATIONS
Many FOMC participants indicated in response to the recent survey on the costs 
and efficacy of asset purchases that they are at least moderately concerned that 
additional asset purchases, and low interest rates more broadly, could increase 
the risk of financial instability.  This box provides an overview of the possible 
financial stability implications of the Committee’s current monetary policy stance.  
The degree of monetary policy accommodation, and the specific monetary policy 
instruments used to deliver that accommodation, including LSAPs and forward 
guidance regarding the federal funds target, all could have implications for 
financial stability.
Keeping interest rates (at all maturities) low has countervailing effects on 
financial stability.  On the one hand, by supporting the recovery, allowing 
borrowers to refinance at lower interest rates, and contributing to higher asset 
prices, low interest rates lead to improved loan performance and stronger 
balance sheets for households, businesses, and financial institutions.  On the 
other hand, low interest rates can create incentives for investors and financial 
institutions to reach for yield by taking on greater duration and credit risk, or to 
increase their use of leverage.  In addition, low rates may contribute to a rise in 
some asset prices to excessive levels, raising the risk of a potentially disorderly 
reversal.  Importantly, these risks can be slow‐moving and difficult to measure in 
real time, but may build over time and emerge as a real threat later on.  The 
recent QS Financial Stability Assessment concluded that while aggregate 
leverage is low and most asset valuations remain broadly in line with historical 
norms, there is some evidence of reach‐for‐yield behavior, including the elevated 
pace of high‐yield bond issuance and eased underwriting standards in the 
leveraged finance market.  The report concludes that the evidence of renewed 
pressure on credit terms and standards does not yet have systemic implications 
given the moderate use of leverage by investors in these markets, but that use of 
leverage and exposures to credit and duration risk might increase over time or a 
larger share of that risk might move into the shadow banking sector if interest 
rates remained persistently low.
LSAPs, specifically, could have additional implications for financial stability.  By 
putting downward pressure on term premiums, LSAPs may encourage both 
financial and nonfinancial firms to lengthen the maturity of their liabilities, which 
reduces the vulnerability of the financial system to funding shortfalls.  Indeed, 
even though long‐term interest rates have risen over the last few months, 
financial and nonfinancial firms continue to take advantage of the relatively low 
level of such rates by lengthening their average debt maturity, albeit at a slower 
pace than earlier in the year.  LSAPs might also lead some market participants to 
take on even more duration or credit risk in order to achieve a specific nominal 
return.  For example, the institutional investors that in many cases have a fixed

nominal return target, such as pension funds and insurance companies, have 
been an important source of the demand for high‐yield bonds and CLOs.
The Committee’s forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and 
its asset purchases can also influence financial stability in several ways.  Most 
directly, by leading market participants to expect lower short‐term interest rates 
in the future, forward guidance can lower current longer‐term rates, resulting in 
the positive and negative consequences for financial stability discussed above.  In 
addition, by increasing the conviction of market participants about the likely 
future level of interest rates, guidance can reduce interest rate volatility to 
unusually low levels for a long period of time, which in turn can induce investors 
to enter into carry trades whose profitability depends on a continuation of the 
low level of interest rates and volatility.  The historic decline in interest rates and 
volatility earlier in the year, the May–June bond market selloff, and the recent 
renewed interest in carry trades as discussed in the QS report all bear witness to 
both the power and the fragility of forward‐guidance‐induced market 
confidence.  Finally, the impetus to risk taking from expectations of a prolonged 
period of low interest rates may currently be held in check by the tentative 
economic outlook.  If this restraint wanes as the economy strengthens and 
interest rates remain low, a broader and potentially excessive increase in risk 
taking could take root.
In conclusion, if the Committee, like the staff, judges that the limited signs of 
excessive risk taking do not currently pose a risk to financial stability and so to 
the outlook for employment and inflation, it may conclude that those signs 
should not be a major factor in setting the degree of policy accommodation at 
present, especially given the risk that inappropriate policy tightening could 
undermine the recovery and so lead to a weaker financial system and a longer 
period of very low rates.  Moreover, Committee participants may judge that if a 
response is needed, a supervisory one, such as the recently issued supervisory 
guidance on leveraged lending, may currently be more appropriate than a 
monetary policy response.  At the same time, if the Committee thought that low 
interest rates, or low volatility, could in the future lead to more widespread risk‐
taking accompanied by increased use of leverage that could ultimately result in 
substantially increased risks to the Committee’s objectives, then it may prefer to 
express its forward guidance in a manner that would clearly preserve its option 
to tighten policy if necessary to mitigate those risks.

back some of their leveraged positions.  Moreover, with the unemployment rate still 
elevated, inflation below 2 percent, and expected inflation well anchored, policymakers 
may judge that strengthening the forward guidance for the federal funds rate at this time 
is unlikely to lead to an undesirable increase in inflation.  They may also judge that the 
language in paragraph B.5 indicating that the Committee will consider financial 
conditions and inflation pressures in determining how long to maintain a highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy provides the Committee with sufficient 
flexibility in setting policy.
In contrast, other policymakers may note that inflation has been particularly low 
in recent months, and believe that it could well become necessary to provide even greater 
monetary policy stimulus, in part by maintaining the current pace of asset purchases, in 
order to ensure that inflation moves up toward 2 percent in coming years.  However, they 
may judge that the recent decline in inflation reflects transitory factors to some extent, 
and that stable long-run inflation expectations and diminishing slack in labor and product 
markets should help move inflation back toward the Committee’s longer-run objective 
even as the pace of asset purchases is reduced.
Finally, some participants may judge that the reduction in the pace of purchases 
together with the signal that further reductions are likely could push mortgage rates up 
further, undermining the recovery in the housing market.  However, mortgage rates 
remain near historically-low levels and participants may view the changes in forward 
guidance in Alternative B as likely to mitigate any increase in rates.  Moreover, though 
Alternative B indicates that the pace of purchases is likely to be scaled back over time, it 
also states that purchases are not on a preset course and so the path of purchases could be 
adjusted if needed in response to changes in the economic outlook.
It is difficult to gauge the market reaction to a statement like Alternative B.  
According to the Desk’s latest survey, most dealers expect a largely unchanged statement 
at the December meeting.  In particular, although the average probability that the first cut 
in the pace of asset purchases will occur in December was roughly twice as high in the 
December survey as in October, the majority of survey respondents do not expect the first 
reduction in asset purchases to occur at this meeting nor do they expect a change in 
forward guidance language.  But, a majority of dealers do expect that the first cut in the 
pace of purchases will be combined with stronger forward guidance for the funds rate—
possibly including a reduction in the threshold for the unemployment rate or new
A

e
s

guidance about policy after the threshold is crossed.  Accordingly, market participants 
may not be too surprised by the pairing of a cut in the pace of asset purchases with 
additional forward guidance and may not view the overall stance of policy as having 
changed much.  In that case, the effects of the announcement on financial market prices 
would be small.  There is a risk, however, that the earlier-than-expected cut in the pace of 
purchases and the language in B.4 signaling that further cuts are likely may have a larger 
impact on investors’ perceptions than the qualitative changes in forward guidance for the 
federal funds rate, boosting both the level and volatility of longer-term interest rates.  The 
extent and duration of higher and more volatile longer-term rates would depend 
importantly on other communications, including the Chairman’s press conference.
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C
Policymakers may view the recent data as confirming that the economy has 
growing underlying strength and also see inflation moving back toward the Committee’s 
longer-run goal and therefore prefer to make an even larger cut in asset purchases and to 
leave the forward guidance for the federal funds rate unchanged as in Alternative C.  
Policymakers may view the expansion of payroll employment observed in recent months, 
along with the decline in the unemployment rate since September 2012, as establishing 
that the economy and the labor market have sufficient momentum to make good progress 
toward the Committee’s objective of maximum employment.  In addition, participants 
might cite the moderate expansion of the economy in the face of significant restraint from 
fiscal policy as evidence that the recovery has become self-sustaining, particularly if 
fiscal restraint wanes in the coming year as they expect.  Moreover, they may judge that, 
despite the net increase in mortgage rates since the spring, housing demand will continue 
to be supported by still-favorable home affordability.  Policymakers may see the decline 
in PCE inflation in recent months as largely due to a temporary slowdown in medical 
price inflation and expect that with stable longer-term inflation expectations, inflation 
will move back up toward 2 percent.
Some policymakers may view the decline in the unemployment rate observed 
over the past year and the solid growth in real gross domestic income as providing more-
accurate indications of the underlying strength of the economy than that provided by real 
GDP; consequently, they may see the economy as evolving along the lines of the “Faster 
Recovery” alternative simulation shown in Tealbook Book A.  Other policymakers may 
judge that potential output is lower than the staff estimates, perhaps because they have
A

s
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) December 12, 2013

Authorized for Public Release
concluded that the slow growth over the past six years has largely been a reflection of 
slower productivity growth combined with an increasing natural rate of unemployment 
and a downward trend in the labor force participation rate.  For either reason, 
policymakers may see little reason to strengthen the forward guidance for the federal 
funds rate as in Alternative B and judge that a more rapid reduction in the pace of 
purchases would be appropriate.
Or policymakers may be concerned that the stronger forward guidance language 
in Alternatives A and B involve a greater commitment to maintain near-zero interest 
rates, which could lead to excessive risk-taking in financial markets, undermine financial 
stability, and ultimately put the achievement of the dual mandate at risk.  As evidence of 
such risks, they may point to the rapid expansion of speculative-grade corporate 
borrowing over the past few years and note that a continuation of such trends could lead 
to elevated losses and consequent financial market stresses in the future along the lines 
discussed in the “Corporate Credit Boom and Bust” alternative simulation shown in 
Tealbook Book A.  For these reasons, they may prefer Alternative C, which leaves the 
forward guidance unchanged.  Some policymakers may also prefer the larger reduction in 
the pace of purchases in Alternative C relative to Alternative B because of these 
concerns, or because they see other costs of additional purchases as outweighing the 
benefits.
Alternative C offers a choice between a continuation of the “flow-based” 
approach to asset purchases in which future reductions in the pace of purchases are 
conditioned on progress toward the Committee’s goals, as in paragraphs C.3 and C.4 of 
the statement, or switching to a “fixed-size” approach in which the Committee states its 
anticipated total size and end date for the program as in paragraphs C.3' and C.4'.  Some 
policymakers may prefer retaining the “flow-based” language because it gives the 
Committee more flexibility to adjust the pace of asset purchases if unforeseen 
circumstances arise.  Alternatively, other policymakers may prefer the “fixed-size” 
language in C.3' and C. 4' because in their view the communication challenges associated 
with the “flow-based” approach contributed to the heightened interest-rate uncertainty 
and volatility last summer.  In particular, a “fixed-size” approach might be easier to 
communicate and would provide market participants with greater up-front clarity about 
the total size of the purchase program and when the program will end.

Based on the Survey of Primary Dealers, a decision to adopt a statement like 
Alternative C would surprise market participants, as most dealers expect the first cut in 
the pace of asset purchases to be both modest and to be accompanied by additional 
forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  A sizable reduction in the pace of purchases 
without strengthening the funds-rate guidance would likely be read by investors as a 
signal that the Committee has a less-accommodative reaction function than previously 
thought.  In response to such a signal, longer-term interest rates would likely rise, equity 
prices and inflation compensation fall, and the dollar appreciate.  If the Committee used 
the language in C.3' and C.4' in which it switches to a “fixed-size” program for asset 
purchases, market participants would find this statement even more surprising and might 
view the Committee’s reaction function as even less accommodative, pushing up long-
term rates further.
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A
Policymakers may be concerned that monetary policy is insufficiently 
accommodative, given that inflation has declined further below the Committee’s longer-
run objective in recent months and has remained below its objective for more than a year.  
They also may see the incoming data as again disappointing expectations that the 
economic recovery will strengthen.  In particular, policymakers may point to the modest 
increase in final sales in the third-quarter real GDP report coupled with recent data 
suggesting that the recovery in the housing market may have stalled.  They may note that 
longer-term interest rates have risen over the intermeeting period and are noticeably 
higher than in the spring, and judge that the increase is undermining the recovery in the 
housing market.  Policymakers may be encouraged by the recent gains in private payroll 
employment but remain skeptical that these gains are sustainable without a broader 
pickup in economic activity.  Moreover, they may judge that the decline in the 
unemployment rate in recent months overstates the improvement in the labor market 
perhaps because labor force participation has declined further, on balance, and the levels 
of long-duration unemployment and of individuals working part time for economic 
reasons remain very high.  They also may believe that more accommodative policy is 
necessary to counteract the long period of considerable slack in the labor market, which 
is damaging the productive capacity of the economy and further depressing aggregate 
demand through a lower level of permanent income.  All told, policymakers may judge, 
in line with the assessment expressed in Alternative A, that there has not been sufficient 
progress towards the Committee’s objectives for the labor market and inflation to warrant

reducing the pace of purchases.  Indeed, policymakers may judge that additional 
accommodation is both necessary and overdue.
Some participants may judge not only that the modal outlook is unsatisfactory but 
also that downside risks to the outlook, though modest, remain large enough to be a 
concern.  In particular, another Congressional impasse on the federal debt limit could 
elevate policy uncertainty and undermine confidence, further restraining household 
spending and business investment in 2014.  At the same time, with underlying inflation 
continuing to run well below 2 percent, some policymakers may see little risk that 
inflation or inflation expectations will move up; indeed, they might be concerned with the 
possibility that persistently low inflation could eventually lead to declines in longer-run 
inflation expectations, resulting in mutually-reinforcing downward dynamics for inflation 
and economic activity along the lines of the “Low Inflation” alternative simulation shown 
in Tealbook Book A.  If so, they may see the configuration of risks, as well as the modal 
outlook, as pointing to the need for greater policy stimulus at this meeting.
Policymakers may see a statement like Alternative A as desirable in part because 
it does not cut the pace of asset purchases and it explicitly lowers the unemployment 
threshold.  Therefore, it should put additional downward pressure on longer-term rates, 
helping to ensure that the recovery gains traction and inflation moves up towards the 
Committee’s longer-run goal.  In addition, some participants may view an explicit 
reduction in the unemployment rate threshold as appropriate because they believe, after 
taking into account a variety of labor market indicators, that the decline in the 
unemployment rate is overstating the improvement in the labor market.  They might also 
see it as useful to provide further guidance about the level of future interest rates over the 
medium term by adding the new language shown in the final paragraph of Alternative A 
regarding the expected path of the federal funds rate after liftoff.  As suggested by the 
Summary of Economic Projections released after the September FOMC meeting, 
policymakers may judge that it will be appropriate to keep the federal funds rate well 
below its longer-run normal level for the next several years, perhaps reflecting lingering 
headwinds from the financial crisis or a desire to commit to keeping the federal funds rate 
low in the medium term in order to spur more rapid economic growth in the near term.
Most market participants do not expect the first reduction in asset purchases to 
occur at this meeting, but they do see it as likely to come fairly soon.  Thus, the elements 
of the statement language in Alternative A that suggest a somewhat later initial reduction

in the pace of purchases might lead market participants to mark up their expected size of 
the purchase program.  In addition, the changes to forward guidance would likely surprise 
market participants, especially because these changes would not be accompanied by a cut 
in the pace of asset purchases.  Overall, in response to an announcement like that in 
Alternative A, longer-term interest rates would likely decline, inflation compensation and 
equity prices might rise, and the dollar might depreciate.  If, however, investors took a 
statement like Alternative A as indicating that the FOMC has become more pessimistic 
about the economic outlook than had been thought, equity prices might not rise or could 
even decline.

The directive that was issued after the October meeting appears on the next page, 
followed by drafts for a December directive that correspond to each of the three policy 
alternatives.  The directive for Alternative A is unchanged; the directives for Alternatives 
B and C include changes to make them consistent with the corresponding postmeeting 
statement.
The directive for Alternative A instructs the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month 
and to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion 
per month.  The draft directive for Alternative B instructs the Desk to purchase agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $35 billion per month, and to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month, beginning in 
January.  The draft directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to purchase agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month, and to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month, beginning in 
January.  All three of the draft directives direct the Desk to maintain the current policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities into new issues.

BALANCE SHEET, INCOME, AND MONETARY BASE
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond in broad terms to Alternatives A, B, and C.  All three alternatives include 
additional asset purchases, though the pace and cumulative amount of purchases differ 
across the alternatives.  Under Alternative B we assume that the pace of purchases is 
reduced multiple times, beginning in January, and the program is completed in September 
2014.  Under Alternative C, the initial reduction in purchases is larger than in Alternative 
B, and the program is brought to a close by mid-2014.  In contrast, under Alternative A 
the pace of asset purchases is assumed to remain unchanged in the first half of 2014 and 
then gradually be reduced to zero by year-end.
Projections under each scenario are based on the staff’s assumptions about the 
trajectory of various components of the balance sheet and the balance sheet normalization 
strategy.1  The projections associated with each of the alternatives assume that when the 
time comes to normalize the balance sheet, the SOMA portfolio shrinks only through 
redemptions of Treasury securities and paydowns of principal from agency MBS; 
consistent with the strategy outlined in the press conference statement following the June 
FOMC meeting, no sales of agency MBS are incorporated.
For the balance sheet scenario that corresponds to Alternative B, monthly 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and of agency MBS are reduced by $5 
billion each in January.  Thereafter, the purchases gradually wind down to zero by the 
end of the third quarter of 2014.  Under these assumptions, purchases total a bit under 
$1.4 trillion over 2013 and 2014, compared with a bit over $1.4 trillion in the December 
staff forecast and $1.3 trillion in Alternative B in the October Tealbook. 2
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” SOMA 
securities holdings under the purchase program assumed for Alternative B peak at about
sheet, can be found in the Appendix that follows this section. 
2 The balance sheet scenario for Alternative B assumes that the first reduction in the pace of
purchases comes in January, while this first reduction is a bit later in the staff forecast reported in Tealbook 
Book A.  Both scenarios assume purchases drop to zero in the third quarter of 2014.

$4.2 trillion in the first quarter of 2015, with $2.4 trillion in Treasury securities holdings 
and $1.7 trillion in agency securities holdings.  We assume that the first increase in the 
target federal funds rate is in the fourth quarter of 2015, two quarters later than in the 
staff forecast and Alternative B of the October Tealbook.  The date for the first increase 
in the federal funds rate represents the staff’s translation of the Committee’s indication in 
Alternative B that it will maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well 
past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, and is intended to 
be representative of all of the elements of forward guidance in that alternative.  Two 
quarters before the first increase in the target federal funds rate, all securities 
reinvestments and rollovers are assumed to cease, and the SOMA portfolio begins to 
contract.3  The size of the portfolio is normalized by late 2021, one quarter later than in 
the October Tealbook.  The balance sheet then begins to expand, with increases in SOMA 
holdings essentially matching the growth of currency in circulation and Federal Reserve 
Bank capital.4  Total assets are $2.5 trillion at the end of 2025, with about $640 billion in 
agency MBS holdings remaining in the SOMA portfolio.
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,” shows the implications of balance 
sheet developments for Federal Reserve income.  Under Alternative B, interest income 
rises while purchases are ongoing, then stabilizes until reinvestments cease, and 
subsequently declines for a number of years as the SOMA portfolio contracts through 
redemptions and paydowns of principal.  Although interest expense is quite small in the 
near term, once the federal funds rate rises, interest expense climbs while reserve 
balances are still quite elevated.  As a result, Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury 
remain robust in the near term but then decline for several years, although they are 
projected to remain positive over the entire projection period.  Annual remittances peak at
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of 
Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse 
repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the 
balance sheet.

about $100 billion in 2015 and trough at about $25 billion later in the decade, and no 
deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $1 
trillion, well above the level that would have been observed without the asset purchase 
programs.
The unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA portfolio is importantly influenced 
by the level of interest rates.  For example, the portfolio was in a $200 billion unrealized 
net gain position at the beginning of this year and is projected to be in a slight unrealized 
net loss position at year-end, reflecting the nearly 100 basis-point rise in the 10-year 
Treasury yield over the course of the year.5  In Alternative B, the unrealized loss position 
is projected to peak at about $340 billion at year-end 2018, primarily reflecting the 
projected rise in interest rates.  The unrealized loss position narrows through the 
remainder of the forecast period as these securities mature and roll off the portfolio.
Under Alternative C, in January, the monthly pace of purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities is reduced by $15 billion, and the pace of agency MBS is reduced by 
$10 billion.  The pace of purchases is assumed to wind down to zero by June 2014.6  
Under this balance sheet scenario, purchases total about $1.3 trillion over 2013 and 2014, 
and the federal funds rate is assumed to lift off in mid-2015, earlier than in Alternative 
B.7  Reinvestment of principal from maturing or prepaying securities ends and 
redemptions begin in late 2014, causing the portfolio to begin to contract.  SOMA 
securities holdings in this scenario peak at about $4.0 trillion in December 2014, and the 
size of the balance sheet is normalized by July 2021, about one quarter earlier than in 
Alternative B.  Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain 
positive throughout the projection period, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative 
remittances from 2009 to 2025 are roughly the same as under Alternative B.

In the scenario for Alternative A, the current pace of purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities and agency MBS is maintained in the near term and then is reduced 
gradually, with purchases ending by the end of 2014.8  Under these assumptions, 
purchases total about $1.8 trillion over 2013 and 2014.  In this scenario, SOMA securities 
holdings increase to a peak of about $4.5 trillion in March 2015.  The first increase in the 
target federal funds rate is assumed to occur in the last quarter of 2015, after the 
unemployment rate drops below 6 percent.  All reinvestments are assumed to cease in the 
second quarter of 2015, and then the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  The size of the 
portfolio is normalized about two quarters later than in the scenario corresponding to 
Alternative B, reflecting the larger amount of asset purchases.  Federal Reserve 
remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive over the entire projection 
period, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 through 
2025 are roughly the same as under Alternative B.
The differences across the scenarios regarding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at liftoff are directly related to the 
magnitude of assumed asset purchases and the timing of the liftoff of the federal funds 
rate, although the level of reserve balances is also contingent on the evolution of other 
balance sheet items.  Reserve balances peak at about $3.3 trillion, $3.0 trillion, and $2.9 
trillion under Alternatives A, B, and C, respectively.  When the federal funds rate lifts off 
from its lower bound, reserve balances round to $3.2 trillion, $2.8 trillion, and $2.7 
trillion under Alternatives A, B, and C, respectively.
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternative Projections for the Monetary Base,” in 
the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the monetary base increases through the 
beginning of 2015 because the purchase program is accompanied by an increase in 
reserve balances.  Once exit begins, the monetary base shrinks, on net, into late 2021, 
primarily because redemptions of securities cause corresponding reductions in reserve 
balances.  Starting around early 2022, after reserve balances are assumed to have 
stabilized at $25 billion, the monetary base begins to expand in line with the growth of 
currency in circulation.  Under Alternative C, the monetary base increases through the 
beginning of 2015 and then contracts, on net, until the size of the portfolio is normalized.  
The projected increases in the monetary base under Alternative C are less than the
objectives for the labor market and inflation occurring more gradually than in the staff forecast.

increases under Alternative B because the size of the purchase program is smaller and it 
ends sooner.  Under Alternative A, the monetary base increases, on net, through early 
2015, as the level of reserve balances climbs in concert with the expansion of the asset 
side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The monetary base then contracts during the 
exit period until the size of the portfolio is normalized.

After advancing briskly in 2013, M2 is projected to increase at a rate roughly in
line with that of nominal GDP in the first quarter of next year.  Thereafter, M2 is forecast
to expand more slowly than nominal GDP, in part because investors are assumed to
reallocate a portion of their elevated M2 balances to riskier investments as economic
conditions improve.9  In 2015 and 2016, M2 growth is depressed as the projected rise in
short-term market rates increases the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets.

This appendix presents the assumptions underlying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Balance Sheet, Income, and Monetary Base,” as well as projections for each major 
component of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS
The balance sheet projections are constructed at a monthly frequency from December 
2013 to December 2025.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed 
to be constant over the projection period at the level observed on November 29, 2013.  The 
projections for all major asset and liability categories under each scenario are summarized in the 
tables that follow the bullet points.
The Tealbook projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative B assume that the 
target federal funds rate begins to increase in the last quarter of 2015, well past the time that the 
unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, and two quarters later than in the December staff 
forecast as well as in the balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the October Tealbook.  
The projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assume liftoff in the second 
quarter of 2015.  In the projection for the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the first 
increase in the target federal funds rate is also assumed to occur in the last quarter of 2015, 
reflecting either an unemployment threshold of 6 percent or inflation and other financial 
conditions that delay liftoff a bit.  In each case, the balance sheet projections assume no use of 
short-term draining tools to achieve the projected path for the target federal funds rate.1
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities
 The assumptions under Alternative B are:
o In the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the Committee is assumed to 
decrease the monthly pace of purchases to $40 billion of longer-term 
Treasury securities and $35 billion of agency MBS beginning in January 
2014.  The pace of purchases is reduced numerous times during the year, and 
purchases stop at the end of the third quarter of 2014.  The Treasury 
securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine
liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse repurchase agreements would be matched 
by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, these draining tools would be wound down as 
the balance sheet returns to its steady-state growth path, so that the projected paths for securities presented 
here would remain valid.

years.  The Treasury and MBS purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s 
holdings of longer-term securities by about $1.4 trillion over 2013 and 2014.
o The Committee is assumed to continue rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction and reinvesting principal payments on agency MBS and 
agency debt securities into agency MBS until mid-2015, six months before 
the first increase in the federal funds rate.  The assumption that maturing 
Treasury securities are rolled over at auction is not particularly important 
because, as a result of the maturity extension program, the SOMA portfolio 
currently holds less than $5 billion of Treasury securities that mature before 
January 2016.
o Starting in the second quarter of 2015—two quarters prior to the assumed 
increase in the target federal funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off 
the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  Subsequently, the portfolio declines 
only through redemptions and paydowns of SOMA assets.
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on staff models using 
estimates of housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical 
providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest rate 
projections generated from the staff’s FRB/US model.2  The projected rate of 
prepayment is sensitive to these underlying assumptions.
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee is assumed to decrease 
the monthly pace of purchases to $30 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and 
$30 billion of agency MBS beginning in January 2014.  The pace of purchases is 
reduced to zero by the end in the second quarter of 2014.  The Treasury securities 
purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  The 
Treasury and MBS purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term 
securities by about $1.3 trillion over 2013 and 2014.  The FOMC continues to 
reinvest the proceeds from principal payments on its agency securities holdings in 
agency MBS until late 2014, six months prior to the assumed increase in the target 
federal funds rate.  Thereafter, all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as 
they mature or prepay.  Subsequently, the portfolio declines only through 
redemptions and paydowns of SOMA assets.
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to continue 
the current pace of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS 
through 2013.  In the second half of 2014, the pace of purchases is reduced in several 
steps, and purchases end in December 2014.  The Treasury securities purchased are 
assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  The Treasury and MBS 
purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about 
$1.8 trillion over 2013 and 2014.  In addition, the Committee is assumed to maintain

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) December 12, 2013

its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt 
and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Starting in mid-2015—two quarters prior to the 
assumed increase in the target federal funds rate—principal payments from all 
securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio.  Subsequently, the portfolio declines 
only through redemptions and paydowns of SOMA assets.
 If interest rates are below (above) the coupon rate on outstanding Treasury securities, 
the market value at which the Federal Reserve purchases such securities will be 
greater (less) than their face value and the Federal Reserve records a premium 
(discount).  In all alternatives, net premiums are roughly unchanged over the course 
of the purchase programs.
 The market value at which the Federal Reserve purchases new agency MBS will 
generally exceed their face value.  As a result, MBS premiums under Alternatives A, 
B, and C, will rise by roughly $14 billion, $8 billion, and $5 billion, respectively.
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is assumed to reach zero by the beginning 
of 2014.
 In all four scenarios, once reserve balances drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  
Purchases of bills continue until such securities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the 
crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reserve buys coupon securities in 
addition to bills to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third 
bills and two-thirds coupon securities.
 The level of foreign currency denominated assets held in the SOMA portfolio is 
assumed to stay constant at about $25 billion.
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to
zero by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments.
 The assets held by TALF LLC decline from about $100 million currently to zero in 
2015.  Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of commitment fees 
collected by the LLC.3  Consistent with events to date, the projections assume the 
LLC does not purchase any asset-backed securities.  (It would have to make such 
purchases if an asset-backed security were received by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York in connection with a decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.)
funding commitment and the repayment of the initial funding amount plus accrued interest.  Additionally, 
the Board of Governors approved the disbursement of contingent interest payments from TALF LLC to 
Treasury and FRBNY that are approximately equal to the excess of the TALF LLC cash balance over the 
amount of outstanding TALF loans less funds reserved for future expenses of TALF LLC.  The first 
payment occurred in February, and additional payments occur on a monthly basis.

 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC decline from about $1 billion to zero in 2016.
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation are assumed to increase at an average annual rate 
of 6 percent through 2015, in line with the staff forecast.  Afterwards, Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation expand at the same rate as nominal GDP in the extended 
Tealbook projection.
 The level of reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) is assumed to be around  
$100 billion, about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and 
international accounts observed over the past three years.
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s General Account (TGA) follow recent patterns 
until the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  
At that point, the TGA drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion because it 
is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and 
invest funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the 
remainder of the forecast period.
 Federal Reserve capital rises 12.5 percent per year from 2014 onward, in line with 
the average rate of the past ten years.4
 In general, increases in the level of Federal Reserve assets are matched by higher 
levels of reserve balances.  All else equal, increases in the levels of liability items, 
such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the 
level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these 
liability or capital items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below        
$25 billion, purchases of Treasury securities are assumed in order to maintain that 
level of reserve balances.
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount 
necessary to cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-
in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset is reported on the liability 
side of the balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  
This liability takes on a positive value when weekly cumulative earnings have not yet 
been distributed to the Treasury and takes on a negative value when earnings fall 
short of the expenses listed above.  In this Tealbook, none of the alternatives results 
in a deferred asset.

TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS5,6
 Under Alternative B, the term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury 
note in the fourth quarter of 2013 is negative 126 basis points, slightly more negative 
than in Alternative B in the October Tealbook.  Over the remainder of the projection 
period, the term premium effect declines slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and 
anticipated normalization of the portfolio.
 Under Alternative C, the contemporaneous term premium effect is negative 120 basis 
points.  The effect is less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer 
securities purchased and liftoff is earlier (and so balance sheet normalization starts 
earlier) than under Alternative B.
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect is about negative 140 basis points in 
the current quarter.  The effect is more negative than in Alternative B because more 
securities are purchased than under Alternative B.
