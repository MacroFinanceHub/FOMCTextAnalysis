Prefatory Note 

 
 

The attached document represents the most complete and accurate version 
available based on original copies culled from the files of the FOMC Secretariat at the 
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  This electronic document was 
created through a comprehensive digitization process which included identifying the best-
preserved paper copies, scanning those copies,1 and then making the scanned versions 
text-searchable.2  Though a stringent quality assurance process was employed, some 
imperfections may remain. 
 

Please note that this document may contain occasional gaps in the text.  These 
gaps are the result of a redaction process that removed information obtained on a 
confidential basis.  All redacted passages are exempt from disclosure under applicable 
provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.    

 

                                                 
1 In some cases, original copies needed to be photocopied before being scanned into electronic format.  All 
scanned images were deskewed (to remove the effects of printer- and scanner-introduced tilting) and lightly 
cleaned (to remove dark spots caused by staple holes, hole punches, and other blemishes caused after initial 
printing). 
2 A two-step process was used.  An advanced optimal character recognition computer program (OCR) first 
created electronic text from the document image.  Where the OCR results were inconclusive, staff checked 
and corrected the text as necessary.   Please note that the numbers and text in charts and tables were not 
reliably recognized by the OCR process and were not checked or corrected by staff. 



  1.  Financial markets generally functioned normally over the intermeeting period (as
discussed in the  box on page 2), and the  few rema ining strains had little ne t effect on interest
rates.

  2.  Over the interm eeting period, the federal funds rate traded at an  average  of 2.47  percent,
close to its intended level of 2-1/2 percent, and intraday volatility in the funds rate was
somewhat below normal, probably as the result of a temporary boost in required reserve
balances attributable to the surge in  deposits after the September 11 attacks.  The D esk
purchased $3.7 billion of Treasury securities in outright operations over the period, including
$0.7 billion in Treasury bills and $3.0 billion in coupon securities.  The outstanding volume
of long-term System RPs increased $5 billion to $24  billion.

MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent D evelopments

(1) Interest rates fell markedly over the intermeeting period.1, 2  Although the

Committee’s decision to reduce the target level of the federal funds ra te 50 basis

points at the October meeting was largely foreseen by market participants, short- and

intermediate-term market interest rates declined somewhat that afternoon, as

investors apparently interpreted the announcement as raising the likelihood of

additional policy easings.  Economic data subsequently released had a weaker-than-

expected cast and helped to bring the net declines in short-term interest rates to 30 to

40 basis points.  Judging by futures market pr ices, investors are confident of at least a

25 basis point cu t in the funds rate  target at the November meeting and pu t roughly

even odds on a 50 basis po int move.  These quotes also suggest that the funds rate is

expected to drop to 1-3/4 percent by early next year (chart).  Markets have priced in

about 1 percentage point of monetary policy tightening over the subsequent twelve

months, likely in  the expectation that the economy will be rebounding rather quickly

then.

(2) Yields on off-the-run Treasury coupon securities fell 30 to 45 basis

points over the intermeeting period, partly reflecting the weaker tone to the

  3.  Yesterday’s announcement that the Treasury would no longer sell securities at the
thirty-year maturity caught market participants unawares, and the yield on the on-the-
run thirty-year bond fell 40 basis points over the next two days, presumably reflecting
an increased scarcity premium that was especially acute as traders scrambled to cover
short positions.

Market Functioning

Brokers and  dealers in money and capital markets generally have returned to
more normal operations since September 11, though some are still at contingency
sites, and the hardest-hit firms have not regained their market shares.  Bottlenecks
in clearance and settlement systems have mostly been resolved, and fails to deliver
government securities are gradually diminishing from the elevated levels of recent
weeks, owing  in part to the reopening of the  on-the-run ten-year Treasury issue in
early October.  The limits on the Desk’s securities lending program that had been
relaxed after September 11 to  enhance the availability of securities in short supply
were reinstituted on October 18.  In the financing market, however, repo rates on
on-the-run five-year and ten-year notes remain well below the rate on general
collateral.  Market liquidity also has been largely restored, though bid-asked spreads
in some markets still tend to widen temporarily on large trades, perhaps reflecting
heightened economic uncertainty more than the effects of any lingering problems
with market infrastructure.

economic outlook and the associated marking down of policy expectations.  In

addition, the market had to digest considerable news on the volume and composition

of Treasury issuance going forward.  As to  the volume of issuance, market participants

apparently now expect a fiscal package implying a larger deterioration in the budget

balance than previously anticipated.  As to the composition of issuance, just yesterday,

the Treasury announced  the suspension  of future sales of thirty -year securities (both

nominal and indexed  to inflation) and hinted that it would scale back its buy-back

program.3  Yields on private securities also moved sharply lower over the intermeeting

period, particularly in the past two days (although it has been d ifficult to get firm

readings of late given volatile market conditions).  Despite the sense of a weaker near-



3

term outlook, investors seemed to become somewhat more confident about longer-

term economic prospects and more willing to take on risk:  Yield spreads on

speculative-grade bonds fell substantially over the period, albeit to levels well above

those in early September.  Moreover, even without much in the way of encouraging

news regard ing third-quarter and prospective earnings, the W ilshire index rose about 5

percent over the intermeeting period and the Nasdaq rebounded 18  percent. 

(3) The dollar’s exchange value has risen modestly against other major

currencies on balance since the October meeting.  With data for foreign industrial

economies also coming  in on the weak side of expectations, market interest rates

abroad declined about as much as in the United States.  Policy interest rates were

lowered 75 basis points in Canada and 25 basis points in  the United K ingdom.  While

the ECB did not adjust its policy stance during the intermeeting period, near-dated

euribor futures appear to embed  expectations of some easing by year-end and  further

moves in early 2002.  Major equity indexes rose 4 to 8 percent over the intermeeting

period in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan, more than reversing declines

recorded in September.  Over the intermeeting period,                                               

                                                                                                           U.S. monetary

authorities did not intervene.

(4) The dollar’s average exchange value against the currencies of our other

important trading partners changed little on net over the intermeeting period.  The

Mexican peso strengthened 2-1/2 percent against the dollar, more than rolling back its

declines in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  The recent

announcement that the Argentine government would seek to restructure its debt

further intensified fears of a default, widening Argentina’s EMBI+ spread  by 600 basis

points, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Reflecting some spillover from

Argentina, the Brazilian real depreciated against the dollar, but only modestly as the

authorities offset som e of that pressure  by sales of dollar-indexed debt.  In  general,



4

risk spreads for most other emerging market economies increased only slightly, on

net, and share prices showed mixed changes . 

(5) Despite the slowing of the economy and the disruptions in financial

markets associated with the September 11 attacks, the debt of households and

businesses has apparently continued to expand at a moderate rate.  The bond market

absorbed a substantial amount of issuance  by investment-grade firms in both

September and October.  Better-rated speculative-grade firms were able to tap the

market in October after a near shutdown of junk issuance in September.  Net issuance

of commercial paper also resumed in October, after a fall-off the prior month, in part

to repay backup lines at banks that had been  drawn upon in September.  Banks report

a further tightening of terms and standards on business loans, but the extent of the

tightening did  not exceed that reported earlier  in the year, and no widespread cut-off

of credit supply seems in train.  Household mortgage borrowing has maintained a

fairly brisk pace, aided by a further reduction in mortgage interest rates that has

triggered another wave of mortgage refinancings.  Consumer credit, in contrast, likely

continued to expand sluggishly through September, restrained in part by the

redirection of some cash extracted from mortgage refinancing to debt consolidation. 

In part boosted by a sizable expansion of federal debt to finance the last round of tax

rebate checks, the to tal debt of the nonfinancial sectors grew at a 7 percent pace in

September . 

(6) After a surge in September that owed importantly to the temporary

buildup of deposits when securities trades failed to settle, the level of M2 declined

slightly in October.  Nevertheless, this monetary aggregate grew at an average rate of

12 percent over the past two months, reflecting the sharp drop in market interest rates

and perhaps a fillip from the deposit of some tax rebates.  The velocity of M2 declined

at a 7-1/4 percen t rate through the first three quar ters of the year, in response mainly

to the substantial reduction in opportunity costs associated with policy easings and



5

perhaps as well to some effects on money demand of mortgage refinancings, tax

rebates, and the d isenchantment of household investors w ith the stock market.

Policy Alternatives

(7) The staff has read incoming economic information as suggesting a more

pronounced near-term contraction than projected in  the last Greenbook, owing to

weaker capital spending and more aggressive inventory liquidation.  The Greenbook

forecast now assumes that the federal funds rate will be cut an additional

1/4 percentage point, to 2-1/4 percent, by year-end, and will remain at this level

through 2002 before rising modestly.  Yields on long-term Treasury securities and

mortgages are expected to change little from their current levels, but those on

investment-grade corporate bonds are projected to decline somewhat as risk

premiums unwind further.  The dollar is assumed to hold near current levels on

foreign exchange markets.  After some near-term softening related to disappointing

corporate earn ings, equity prices should trend up gradually, albe it on an appreciably

higher track than expected in the September Greenbook.  The impetus from fiscal

policy is now expected to provide a b igger boost to activity in 2002 and 2003.  Against

this policy and financial backdrop, the staff expects real GDP to turn  up noticeab ly in

the spring.  Although output growth begins to outpace that of its potential in the

second half of next year, the typical lag in  the response of the unemployment rate

explains why it continues to edge higher until mid 2002 and only slips off later in the

forecast period.  With the emergence of some labor market slack, core PCE inflation

edges lower to 1-1/4 percent in 2003.

(8) The Com mittee might choose to leave the federal funds rate unchanged

if it were of the view that action at this meeting would be unlikely to affect the

contours of the near-term economic downturn and that past monetary policy easing,

probable new fiscal measures, and the natural resiliency of private  demand should

provide enough stimulus to underpin a solid economic recovery before long.  In

effect, the Committee would implicitly be making the judgment that the gap between

the current real funds rate and its likely equilibrium value provides a sufficient amount



8

of impetus to economic activity over time (see chart and table).  Indeed, the

Committee may be especially reluctant to ease policy if it thinks the equilibrium real

funds rate is likely to r ise in the future–as risk and equ ity premiums narrow, as is

seemingly consistent with recent stock price gains, but also as the thrust of fiscal

policy intensifies.  With the budget package still working its way through the legislative

process, considerable uncertainty surrounds the magnitude of the coming fiscal

stimulus.  Because this uncertainty should be resolved relatively promptly, the

Committee may prefer to  keep policy unchanged at th is meeting so as to be able to

calibrate better its policy action to the size and composition of what becomes law.  If

the Committee saw easing as a close call, with the federal funds rate as low as 2-1/2

percent, it might be argued that action should be deferred at this meeting so that the

Committee would have more scope to respond to potential adverse shocks down the

road.  As described in the box on the zero bound to nominal interest rates on page 9,

this tactic of “saving your ammunition” would follow from the judgment that policy

action in a narrow window following an adverse shock would be more effective in

bolstering activity over time than lowering rates more aggressively now so that any

future shock falls on a stronger economy.

(9) Committee inaction at this meeting, even if combined with a statement

reaffirming the assessment of predominant downside risks, would surprise market

participants.  Considerable doubts would be created about whether the federal funds

rate would go as low as 1-3/4 percent by the early months of next year as market

participants currently expect.  In consequence, other short-term in terest rates would

move noticeably higher.  The likely upward movement of bond yields would be

tempered by an immediate selloff of equities.  To the extent that the outlook for

spending and income tu rned gloomier, the exchange value of the dollar might fail to

appreciate despite the tighter-than-anticipated policy stance.

The Zero Bound  to the Nom inal Interest Rate

With the overnight interest rate at 2-1/2 percent, the zero bound to the nominal
interest rate may loom larger now in the Committee’s deliberations than at any time in the
past four decades.  The experience of Japan, in which the po licy rate has flirted with zero
for five years and economic performance has been dismal, serves as a cautionary note for
monetary policy makers.  Of course, the short-term rate in the United States is still some
distance away from zero, and intermediate- and longer-term rates here remain far above
levels seen in Japan.  Even if Committee members were to consider the zero bound as
potentia lly relevan t, observers have  put forward two quite different approaches to
avoiding a situation in which the economy is weak and further reductions in the nominal
policy rate are not possible.

     1. “Saving your ammunition.”  It may be viewed as quite possible that adverse shocks
will emerge in the near term; in particular, global events could prompt further
downdrafts in househo ld and business confidence.  The C ommittee may  want to
be able to counter such adverse outcomes by easing, on the expectation that being
seen as responsive to current events helps to bolster confidence.  Action taken
now limits the scope for such future monetary policy reaction to confidence-
shaking events.

     2. Respondin g preemptively  to skewed risks.   If it were accepted that policy op tions would
be severely curtailed should the federal funds rate hit its zero floor and that the
adverse consequences would be potentially quite large, the Committee might want
to act now to reduce the possibility of that outcome.  That is, the cost of easing
too much  currently may weigh less in the Committee’s consideration than the cost
of easing insufficiently now and winding up pinned to the zero bound at a later
date.

     
Staff analysis of the zero bound tends to support the latter view:  Avoiding the

zero bound counsels m ore aggressive action in advance of zero in  response to adverse
shocks  than is the  norm.  Moreover, timely policy  actions taken sooner wou ld work  to
put the economy on a stronger footing when adverse shocks subsequently hit.  But that
determination would be less persuasive if the Committee’s view, as opposed to the
mechanisms embodied in most econometric models, was that its action could have a
greater effect on confidence, and hence  the econom y, if taken on the  heels of an adverse
shock or that monetary policy operations could still adequately stimulate the economy
even if the nominal short-term  interest rate were ze ro. 
    



10

(10) The Committee may consider the staff forecast to be both probable and,

under the circumstances, a satisfac tory outcome, and it may judge that an immediate

cut in the federal funds rate of 25 basis points is justified.  With investors skittish and

risks predominately skewed to  the downside, the Committee may be reluctant to

adopt a policy stance that is appreciably tighter than financial markets expect, which

could further  adversely affect household and business sentiment.  The small

disappointment of market expectations implied by the adoption of this alternative

might actually be viewed favorably by the Committee if it wished to slow the current

pace of easing from its recent trajectory to help forestall financial markets from

building in the expectation of considerably more easing than appropriate to achieve

the Committee’s objectives.  In effect, a modest disappointment now may pose less of

a strain  on markets  than a  more  sizable one later on . 

(11) The Committee may judge that a 50 basis point policy move is

warranted on the grounds that the path of output is likely to fall short of that in the

staff forecast–either because the contraction will be greater or the subsequent pickup

less robust.  The C ommittee  might anticipate the near-term outcomes for spending to

be weaker than in the staff outlook if, for example, it suspected that the ongoing

contraction of foreign economic activity and the stresses in financial markets of

developing countries may portend greater-than-anticipated adverse feedbacks on U.S.

production.  The Committee may also have doubts that household and business

spending w ill respond as vigorously to likely fiscal in itiatives as embedded in the staff

forecast.  Even if the Committee viewed a 50 basis point move as a bit larger than

necessary given its current assessment of the economic situation, the more substantial

move might be favored if some weight were placed on the possibility of shocks that

would be sufficiently adverse to make the zero bound to nominal interest rates a real

constraint on the effectiveness of monetary policy at some point in the future .  

(12) As already noted, market participants are about evenly split between



11

expecting 1/4 percentage point and 1/2 percentage point of easing at th is meeting. 

Thus , some portion of them would be disappointed by the cho ice of ei ther action. 

Working to temper any reaction, though, would be the sense that it is more likely that

the timing of the easing they are expecting–in the neighborhood of 3/4 percentage

points over the next half year–had changed, not the cumulative amount.  Market

participants universally expect that the balance of risks will remain tilted toward

economic weakness, so not much would be read in its retention.  A 25 basis point

easing would prompt some backup in short- and intermediate-term rates and a decline

in equity prices.  A half point ease, in contrast, would pull short-term rates lower and,

unless countered by a clear sense in the statement that the Committee had viewed its

action as likely bringing this easing phase to a close, would lead market participants  to

mark down the entire expected path of policy rates.  The implied support to spending

would likely bolster equity markets and offset to a considerab le extent any downward

pressure on the exchange value of the do llar directly emanating from lower interest

rates.

(13) Given the funds rate assumption in the staff forecast, M2 growth over

the October-to-March interval is expected to fall appreciably, to about a 7-1/2 percent

annual rate.  The effects on opportunity costs of the previous easings, as well as that

of the further 25 basis point cut in the s taff pro jection , should abate over  time. 

Together with the Greenbook’s forecast for nominal GDP, the implied rate of decline

in M2 velocity lessens from about 10-1/2 percent in the current quarter to

5-1/2 percent in the first quarter. 

(14) Over the six months from September to March, the staff projects that

growth of the total debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors will slip to a 4-1/2 percent

rate, reflecting a slowing in the expansion of household debt.  Consumer  credit

borrowing is expected to  be especially  light, owing to depressed spending on durab les. 

Even the growth of home mortgage debt, which has been exceptionally robust in



12

keeping with the decline in mortgage rates, is seen as tailing off a little as refinancings

diminish and housing activity slows.  Business borrowing is likely to stay around its

third-quarter pace, concentrated in the corporate bond market.  Neither banks, which

have been tightening terms and standards on C&I loans, nor the commercial paper

market, which also has become more selective, are anticipated to be major sources of

funds.  Federal debt should be rising at only a 1/2 percent annual rate, as the budget is

foreseen to be in a modest deficit position on average over this six months.

Directive and Balance-of-Risks Language

(15) Presented below for the members' consideration is draft wording for

(1) the directive and (2) the “balance of risks” sentence to be included in the press

release issued after the  meeting (not part of the directive).

(1) Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and

financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote

sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the

Committee in the immediate future seeks  conditions in  reserve markets

consistent with MAINTAINING/INCREASING/reducing the federal

funds rate AT/to an average of around ___2-1/2 percent.

(2) “Balance o f Risks” Sentence

Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and

sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available,

the Committee believes that the risks [ARE BALANCED WITH

RESPECT TO PROSPECTS FOR BOTH GOALS] [ARE

WEIGHTED MAINLY TOWARD CONDITIONS THAT MAY 

GENERATE HEIGHTENED INFLATION PRESSURES] [continue

to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic

weakness] in the foreseeable future.
